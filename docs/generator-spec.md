# Blueprint Synthesis — Plan

**Status:** Draft, updated 2026-06-13. **Gate 1 passes; gate 2 routing
converges at 1-lane, 4-lane × 1-cutter (0 unmatched legs, correct halves),
and 4-lane × 4-cutter (routing converges, both floors 0 unmatched legs —
hop-receiver adjacency constraint resolved the consecutive-catcher artifact).
Per-group density accounting + lift-exit exclusion landed. 16-lane routing
failed (unreachable terminal after 1128s) — routing capacity, not placement.**
Gate 1: `test_synth_diagonal_full_belt_2x4` (8-pair diagonal on Foundation_2x4,
32/32 edges, validates + interprets with hops). Gate 2:
`test_half_splitter_2x4_placement_feasible` (16 lanes × 4 cutters/lane,
placement-only); `test_single_lane_four_cutters_halves_land_on_correct_sides`
(1 lane × 4 cutters/lane, full end-to-end: synthesis → routing → interpret,
correct halves); `test_four_lane_four_cutters_2x4_routes` (4-lane × 4-cutter,
full synthesis → routing → lift trace, 16 machines placed).
Row model + feedback loop landed, hop direction constraints landed, A\*
heuristic landed (3.9× routing speedup), multi-face port support landed,
`Group`/`Locked`/`Region` sink pinning landed, `CutterSpec` landed (cutter fan
with `Region`-pinned west/east outputs). WP-J done. WP-K done. WP-L landed.
WP-H landed. **South→north flow convention landed 2026-06-11** (sources south,
sinks north — user decision, applies to every design); **WP-M2 done
(2026-06-11)** — Mirrored cutter fan, `CutterSpec.validate()` region-capacity
check, the 16-lane gate-2 test, and a `_grow_tree` routing-unreachability fix
(no-hop fallback search) and `_assign_ports` monotone-matching fix (avoids
crossed west/east-half assignments when both halves land on the same
platform face). Working tree: 289/289 pass. Crossing budget gate landed
(WP-N task 3d). Remaining: WP-L's region-internal flow ordering (not
gate-blocking); 4+ lane cutter fan routing convergence (see WP-N task 4
outcome below).
**New blockers found 2026-06-11 via gate-2 viz review (§2a "Gate-2
blockers")**: (1) gate 2's `hop_range=8` exceeds the in-game launcher/catcher
limit (1–4 blank tiles between ⇒ `hop_range` ≤ 5); (2) gate 2 uses 1 cutter
per lane vs. the real Half Splitter's 4 (1→4 split → 4 cutters → 4→1 merge
×2). Both block treating gate 2 as representative of the real design — fix
before further north-star work.
**Blocker 1 actioned 2026-06-11**: added `lift.MAX_HOP_RANGE = 5` (shared —
`pathfinder.RoutingGraph` now raises if `hop_range > MAX_HOP_RANGE`,
`lift._resolve_hops`'s search is bounded by it too) and clamped gate 2 from
`hop_range=8` to `hop_range=MAX_HOP_RANGE`. **Result is the predicted real
feasibility finding, not a clean pass**: gate 2 is now **flaky** at the legal
hop range — 3/4 runs passed (16–93s), 1/4 failed with 3 overused cells after
`MAX_ITERS=60`. CP-SAT placement (`place.py`) is unseeded, so each run routes
a differently-shaped instance; at `hop_range=5` the current placeholder
(1-cutter/lane, 64-node) topology sits right at PathFinder's convergence
boundary. Blocker 2 (cutter count) is still open and will change the routing
problem's scale 4× (256 nodes at 16 lanes) — tuning placement-determinism/
`MAX_ITERS` against today's placeholder topology is likely wasted; resolve
blocker 2 first, then re-assess gate-2 convergence against the representative
topology. Gate 1 (`test_synth_diagonal_full_belt_2x4`) is unaffected
(`hop_range=4`, still passes).
**Blocker 2 actioned 2026-06-11**: generalized `CutterSpec`/
`netlist_from_cutter_spec` with `cutters_per_lane` (default 1, unchanged
behavior); `cutters_per_lane=4` gives the real 1→4 split → 4 cutters → two
4→1 merges per lane, expressed as plain edges sharing `src_i`/`sink_i_w`/
`sink_i_e` (no new node kinds — confirmed lift/interpret handle N-way
fan-out/fan-in with no code changes). **Result: a harder, deterministic
blocker, not a tuning problem.** `lanes=1` validates end-to-end (`lift.validate
== []`, `unmatched_legs == 0`, correct halves) — but **CP-SAT placement is
INFEASIBLE (reproducible, <1s, independent of `PYTHONHASHSEED`/process) for
any `cutters_per_lane >= 2` combined with `lanes >= 2`**, including the
4-lane/Foundation_2x4 checkpoint and the 16-lane gate 2. Root cause:
`place.py`'s fan-out cross-group ordering (~lines 660–690) requires one
fan-out group's machines to sit entirely left/right of another's, assuming
each group routes onward in one shared direction — but cutter-fan groups
route to *both* a west-Region sink and an east-Region sink, so two lanes'
groups can't be linearly ordered. New tests
(`test_four_lane_four_cutters_2x4_halves_land_on_correct_sides`,
`test_synth_half_splitter_2x4`) are marked `xfail(strict=True)` documenting
this. **Decision (2026-06-11): this is the project's core problem surfacing
on schedule, not a regression.** The placer's fan-group constraints encode
"routes never cross" as *hard* constraints, and the Half Splitter cannot be
routed without crossings (every lane feeds both Regions; the human build
needed 145 hops) — so a no-crossing model *must* prove it infeasible. The
fix is a contract change, not a constraint patch: the placer produces a
geometry whose **crossing demand fits routing capacity** (hops + lifts +
channel slack), and PathFinder pays for the crossings. Full plan with
ordered tasks: **WP-N (§7.2)** — first step is re-routing the human build's
placement (a complete placement existence proof of exactly this instance).
Suite state: 289 collected, 289 pass, 0 xfails.
Scaling plan: §2a (architecture) + WP-I…WP-N (§7.2) — negotiated-congestion
routing for dense platforms.**
**WP-N task 1 done (2026-06-11, evidence corrected on review — see the
correction in §7.2 task 1): single floor doesn't converge; lifts do — tasks
3–4 target 3-D.** Re-routed the UNFINISHED Half Splitter's full topology
(16 lanes × 4 cutters/lane, 48 nets) via PathFinder, human placement held
fixed, `hop_range=MAX_HOP_RANGE`. The first run's "structural dead-end in
8.4s" was an artifact of a **real product bug found during review**:
`lift.kind()` classifies *interior* hop launchers/catchers as platform IO,
so `route.strip_belts` keeps them and `strip_and_reroute` turns the human's
290 hop-endpoint cells into phantom obstacles. With them stripped,
single-floor failure is **congestion, not structure**: 124 overused cells
at `MAX_ITERS=60` (84s); at `MAX_ITERS=300` the run instead dies on a
`_grow_tree` self-cornering dead-end after 546s (a router-robustness wart,
not a capacity verdict). The human's complete single-floor build keeps
single-floor feasibility theoretically open, but the engineering decision
stands: the lift retry converges in 1.9s (15/36 nets use a lift edge)
*even with* the phantom obstacles still in place — 3-D is the path.
New scope from the review: fix interior-hop stripping (position-aware
distinction in `strip_belts`/`kind`, exactly the "interior position is
what distinguishes a hop endpoint from platform IO" rule §2a already
states) — required for re-routing *any* hop-bearing blueprint, independent
of WP-N. `strip_and_reroute` also needs multi-layer `passable` +
`lift_enabled` plumbing (task 3). **Viz review of the 2-floor solution
(2026-06-11) found two more latent bugs and a calibration need** — the
passable set wrongly includes the ports-only boundary band (56 non-port
entities emitted there), `_cell_to_entity` emits belts with its `layer`
argument instead of the cell's floor, and the hop/lift cost model inverts
human practice (router prefers an empty floor 1 over launcher/catcher
jumps; floor 1 is not free in the real 48-lane design) — all folded into
WP-N tasks 3e/3f. Details: §7.2 WP-N task 1.
**WP-N task 2 done (2026-06-11):** `synth.MACHINE_RATES` (machine type → belt
fraction, measured from the corpus) + `per_lane()`; `CutterSpec.cutters_per_lane`
now derives to 4 by default (explicit override kept for the placeholder
1-cutter/lane tests). Netlist-level only, independent of task 1.
**WP-N task 3e item 1 done (2026-06-11):** `strip_belts(bp, layer, netlist=...)`
strips interior hop launcher/catcher entities (cells not in `netlist.nodes`
when built with `contract_hops=True`) alongside belts; `strip_and_reroute`
passes its netlist through. New `TestStripInteriorHops` regression test
(Half Splitter: 290 hop endpoints stripped, 48 platform IO ports kept).
275/275 pass + 2 strict xfails, `just lint` clean.
**WP-N task 3e item 2 done (2026-06-11):** `pathfinder._build_passable`
excludes the platform's ports-only edge ring from `passable` (except net
endpoints); `strip_and_reroute` now calls it. **The band was load-bearing,
not latent**: `test_single_lane_four_cutters_halves_land_on_correct_sides`
(smallest `cutters_per_lane=4` checkpoint) now oscillates forever between
two interior cells — a PathFinder tie-breaking pathology (symmetric costs,
history can't break the tie), not a capacity ceiling. Marked
`xfail(strict=True)` per the WP-N hints ("record it, don't tune around it").
New `TestPortBandPassability` (first test to exercise `strip_and_reroute`'s
`platform` kwarg). 277/280 pass + 3 strict xfails, `just lint` clean.
**WP-N task 3e per-floor belt emission fix done (2026-06-11):**
`_cell_to_entity` no longer takes a `layer` argument — every emitted entity
(belts, junctions, hop sender/receiver) uses the cell's own floor (`cell[2]`)
instead of a caller-supplied single layer. Previously only the lift-entry
branch did this; the hop and plain-belt branches stamped `layer` (always 0
today, since `strip_and_reroute` builds a single-floor `passable` set), so a
multi-floor tree would have silently emitted every floor-1 cell onto floor 0.
No behavior change yet (current routing is single-floor, so `cell[2] ==
layer` always held) — this unblocks the next item, lift-aware
`strip_and_reroute`, without a latent floor bug. `emit_entities` dropped its
now-unused `layer` param too. New `TestPerFloorEmit` (2 tests: a layer-1 via
cell from a lift-crossing route, and hop sender/receiver entities on a
non-zero floor). 279/279 pass + 3 strict xfails, `just lint` clean.
**WP-N task 3e lift-aware `strip_and_reroute` done (2026-06-11):**
`_build_passable` gained `extra_layers: tuple[int, ...] = ()`: each extra
floor is opened fully passable over the platform's bounding box (ring
included — there are no ports or machines on an extra floor).
`strip_and_reroute` gained `lift_enabled: bool = False`; when set, floor
`layer + 1` becomes the sole `extra_layers` entry, belts are stripped from it
too, its kept entities join the rebuild, and `RoutingGraph(...,
lift_enabled=True)` may route nets through it via lift edges — the 2-floor
approach the WP-N task-1 experiment validated at scale.
`route.reroute_with_junctions` passes `lift_enabled` through unchanged. New
`TestLiftAwareStripAndReroute` (3 tests): `_build_passable`'s extra floor is
fully open including the ring; a topological-crossing scenario on
`Foundation_1x1` (west<->east port pair vs. south<->north port pair, forced
to share a cell on one floor by a Jordan-curve argument) raises
`RoutingError` with `lift_enabled=False` and converges with
`lift_enabled=True`, landing entities on floor 1 and round-tripping via
`lift.trace`/`lift.isomorphic`. 282/282 pass + 3 strict xfails, `just lint`
clean.
**WP-N task 3a done (2026-06-11):** deleted the 2-member fan-group adjacency
constraint (`abs(m_x[a] - m_x[b]) == 1`) from `place.py`'s placement model —
no replacement, per the spec ("proximity is already rewarded by the
wire-length objective"). This constraint, combined with the R=1 Mirrored
cutter's second cell sitting west of its anchor, forced two same-row cutters
to overlap, making `CutterSpec(lanes=1, cutters_per_lane=2)` CP-SAT
INFEASIBLE. New `test_single_lane_two_cutters_halves_land_on_correct_sides`
(`TestCutterSynthesize`): 1 lane x 2 cutters/lane on `Foundation_1x1` at
`hop_range=MAX_HOP_RANGE` now places, routes, validates at zero unmatched
legs, and both sinks carry the correct half. The `>=2 lanes` xfails are
untouched — that INFEASIBLE comes from the separate cross-group-ordering
constraint (problem 2), not this one. 283/283 pass + 3 strict xfails, `just
lint` clean.
**WP-N task 3b done (2026-06-12):** replaced the single `row_y` per stage
with a stage **band** (`band_lo`/`band_hi`) — each machine gets its own y
variable bounded by its stage's band, routing channels are between bands, and
a weighted compactness penalty (2× stage machine count × band height) keeps
bands collapsed to a single row when the topology doesn't need vertical
spread. Fan-out groups become **blocks** with `block_lo_x`/`block_hi_x`
derived from `min_equality`/`max_equality` over member x-positions (including
second cells of multi-cell machines); cross-block ordering by source x
(`block_hi[i] + 1 <= block_lo[i+1]`). The block filter was lowered from
`>= 2` machine children to `>= 1` (single-cutter-per-lane groups now get
ordering constraints, preventing vertical stacking that blocked second-cell
output routes); groups whose machines appear in multiple blocks are excluded
(swapper topology: two sources feed the same machine). Subsumes problem 3
(16-column × 4-tall human layout now admitted by the band model). 283/283
pass + 3 strict xfails unchanged, `just lint` clean. Next: 3c (scoped facing
constraints), 3d (crossing-budget capacity), 3f (hop/lift cost calibration);
the oscillation xfail is also fair game (PathFinder tie-breaker, e.g.
deterministic by `net_id`).
**WP-N task 3c done (2026-06-12):** scoped facing constraints so that
`m_r == flow_r` applies only to machines with an output edge to an
off-primary-face sink (or an input edge from an off-primary-face source),
replacing the old `_add_output_faces_toward` constraint that forced ALL
machines toward a face. Minimum spacing for off-primary-face edges increased
from 2 to 3 (prevents adjacent machines from competing for the same routing
cell). All 3 xfail reasons updated: failure mode is now PathFinder routing
congestion, not CP-SAT placement infeasibility — placement succeeds for all
topologies as of tasks 3a-3c. The three former xfail tests are now
placement-only assertions (call `place()` directly, verify machine count);
full routing assertions deferred to task 4. 283/283 pass + 0 xfails,
`just lint` clean.
**WP-N task 3f done (2026-06-13):** lowered `HOP_PENALTY` from 2.0 to 1.5
(sweep found 1.5 as the lowest value where all existing tests pass — 0.5 and
1.0 broke the 2-cutter test). Added `SYMMETRY_BREAK = 1e-4` tie-breaking bias
to `_grow_tree`'s step/hop/lift cost computations: `(hash(nb) ^ net.net_id) %
997 * SYMMETRY_BREAK` — breaks the deterministic oscillation where two nets
have identical costs and PathFinder's history pricing can never break the tie.
This resolved the 1-lane 4-cutter xfail. 286/286 pass, `just lint` clean.
**WP-N task 3d done (2026-06-13):** crossing budget gate. Empirical capacity
experiment: routed all 24 permutations of 4 groups on `Foundation_2x4` at
`hop_range=5`, single floor. All inversion counts (0–6) converge; occasional
1-cell failures at inv=4 are nondeterministic (CP-SAT placement variance +
router tie-breaking), not capacity limits. Capacity =
C(n_groups, 2) — the theoretical maximum, empirically confirmed.
`_check_crossing_budget()` extracts group pairs from pinned ports, counts
inversions, raises `CrossingBudgetExceeded` if over capacity. Called at the
top of `place()`. 289/289 pass, `just lint` clean.
**WP-N task 4 done (2026-06-13):** output clearance, `lift_enabled` plumbing,
and test upgrades. Fan-out group output clearance constraint in `place.py`:
within each group of multi-cell machines sharing a source, machine pairs at
the same x-column (anchor or second cell) must have y-spacing >= 2 — prevents
stacked cutters from creating physical chains (a functional correctness issue
for interpret). `lift_enabled` plumbed through `synthesize_cutter`/`_lower`/
`synthesize`. `_MAX_RETRIES` raised from 3 to 5.
`test_single_lane_four_cutters_halves_land_on_correct_sides` upgraded from
placement-only to full end-to-end (0.1s, correct halves). The 4-lane and
16-lane tests remain placement-only: the output clearance constraint spreads
machines beyond the router's convergence capacity even with lifts (7 overused
cells after 60 iterations, ~411s for 4-lane). **The current blocker for gate 2
at scale is the tension between correctness (clearance required) and
routability (clearance-spread placement exceeds router capacity).** Next step:
routability-aware placement objectives or router improvements. 289/289 pass,
`just lint` clean.

**WP-N task 6 done (2026-06-13):** root-cause fix for 4-lane routing failure
plus router ordering improvements. Three changes:

1. **Source group-pinning** (`synth.py`): `netlist_from_cutter_spec` now pins
   each source to a distinct port group (round-robin `i % n_src_groups`)
   when the platform has multiple groups. Previously all 4 sources were
   assigned to the first group (x=-12,-11,-10,-9); all 16 source→machine
   edges crossed the same x-buckets, forcing the density constraint to
   require channel height ≥ 16, which pushed machines to y=19 — far from the
   actual sinks at y=8-11. With sources spread to x=-12, 8, 28, 48, max
   bucket density drops to 4, machines land at y=8, and routing converges in
   ~3s.

2. **Off-face-aware placement** (`place.py`): band ceiling capped at
   `max(max_sink_y + 8, input_y + 3 + 3 * n_stages)` when off-face sinks
   exist (vs. unconditional `output_y - 3`); balance target shifted from
   face midpoint to `(input_y + avg_sink_y) // 2` with weight proportional
   to off-face sink count; ring-column avoidance penalty; low-y decision
   strategy.

3. **Router net ordering** (`pathfinder.py`): initial sort by descending HPWL
   (longest bounding-box nets first); per-iteration critical-net-first
   resorting (nets using overused cells route first).

**Result:** 4-lane × 4-cutter synthesis → routing → validate succeeds (1
unmatched leg, ~13s total). Machines at y=8 (vs. y=19 before), objective
2952 (vs. 4672). 289/289 pass.

**Per-group density and lift-hop emit fixes (2026-06-13):** three changes
resolving §7.3 steps 1 and 3.

1. **Per-group density accounting** (`place.py`): density constraints now
   partition source→machine edges in channel 0 by source group index.
   `ch_edges` key changed from `channel_index` to `(channel_index,
   group_key)`. With group-pinned sources spatially separated, per-bucket
   density drops from 16 (global) to ~4 (one group's fan-out); 16-lane
   machines land at y=7-13 (was y=19). Resolves Q9.

2. **Lift-hop entity emission** (`pathfinder.py`): three bugs fixed in
   `_cell_to_entity`: (a) added `_unit_direction` — hop edges span multiple
   cells, producing non-unit vectors `(5,0)` that didn't match the lift emit
   table; (b) lift in/out direction detection now checks `hop_edges` as
   fallback for the continuation after a lift exit; (c) `_grow_tree` no
   longer allows hops from lift exit cells (detects predecessor on a
   different floor).

3. **4-lane × 4-cutter test upgraded** from placement-only to full synthesis
   → routing → lift trace (`test_four_lane_four_cutters_2x4_routes`).

**Remaining:** lift exit cells on the extra floor have directional output in
`_occupancy` but no physical belt entity — `unmatched_legs` counts these as
gaps. The routing tree is valid (0 overused cells); the emit model can't
represent the lift entity's cross-floor exit + same-floor continuation.

**Hop-receiver adjacency constraint (2026-06-13, §7.3 step 6):** fixed the
consecutive hop-catcher artifact.  Root cause: for fanin nets, the hop
*sender* in growth direction becomes the item-flow *receiver* after the edge
flip — and `BeltPortReceiverInternalVariant` has `ins=∅` (no adjacent-cell
input).  If a growth-direction hop sender already had outgoing step edges (from
earlier terminal paths), those flip into incoming step edges — items arriving
from adjacent belts that the receiver can't accept.  Fix in `_grow_tree`:
(1) for fanin nets, block hops from cells with `cell_out > 0` (existing
step-edge outputs would flip into unmatched inputs) and from cells adjacent
to existing item-flow receivers; (2) for fanout nets, block hop destinations
adjacent to existing item-flow receivers.  `item_recv_cells` tracks cells
that become receivers in item flow (growth-direction destination for fanout,
growth-direction source for fanin).  4-lane × 4-cutter L1 unmatched legs:
2 → 0.  Test upgraded to assert `unmatched_legs(result, 1) == 0`.
289/289 pass, lint clean.

**Lane-group decomposition (2026-06-13, §7.3 step 7):** three routing
improvements for scaling to 16-lane routing.

1. **Lane-group routing** (`pathfinder.py`): `_assign_net_groups` assigns each
   net to a source port group by propagating group membership through netlist
   edges. `_route_by_group` routes groups sequentially with retained
   inter-group occupancy — each group's `pathfinder_route` sees prior groups'
   cells as occupied, steering away via cost pricing. Joint fallback if
   cross-group overlaps remain. Activated when >12 grouped nets.

2. **Own-nets convergence scope**: `pathfinder_route` convergence check now
   only counts overused cells where at least one occupant belongs to the
   current routing set. Prevents per-group routing from stalling on
   cross-group occupancy it cannot rip up.

3. **Routing speedups**: lift-aware A\* heuristic (adds `LIFT_COST` when cell
   and terminal are on different floors); stall detection (early termination
   when overused count hasn't improved over the last 15 iterations);
   configurable `max_iters` parameter.

**Result:** 4-lane × 4-cutter synthesis → routing converges in ~11s with
lifts + group routing. 8-lane pending. 16-lane still running.
291/291 pass (2 new group routing tests), lint clean.

**North star:** synthesize *dense, compact, single-platform* blueprints from a
functional spec — e.g. "on a 2×8 full belt, extract both diagonals and pin the
upper-left diagonal to the 4 left outputs and the upper-right to the 4 right."
These are hard to route by hand and are what make factories compact. That is the
product.

**Easy platforms are the test harness, not the goal.** A "rotate 12 belts 180°"
is a 10-second hand build; here it exists only as an end-to-end test and a
regression floor. The hard target is intra-platform **place-and-route**.

---

## 0. Status & handoff (2026-06-10)

**Built and green** (268 tests pass, 0 xfail, `just test`, ruff clean):
- `blueprint.py` — faithful `.spz2bp` codec.
- `generator.py` — tile-replication generator: builds the rotator family
  (180/cw/ccw × 1×1/1×4) from one lifted tile. `Entity`, lift/stamp/build,
  functional `diff`, per-floor text `render`. 1×4 platforms get font-rendered
  silk-screen labels (direction text as trash-block pixel art, one character
  per gap between belt units, centered) plus a name-tag `Label` entity.
- `font.py` — pre-extracted 10×14 mono bitmap font (95 printable ASCII glyphs,
  stored as row bitmasks; no Pillow runtime dependency). `silkscreen()` renders
  text as `Trash` entities at a given origin and scale.
- `data/platforms.json` — seam-aware platform geometry + ground-truth port
  positions for all 13 Foundation types (calibrated from templates).
- `lift.py` — recovers a machine-level netlist from a placed blueprint. Belt
  direction is calibrated for **all** routing variants (belts + every
  splitter/merger); **machines expand to multi-cell footprints**
  (`_machine_footprint`, 3-D offsets `(dx, dy, dl)`). `trace_layer`,
  `unmatched_legs`, `edge_kinds`. **Lifts the rotator family + half-destroyer
  + the cutter at 0 unmatched legs.** The **stacker** (2-in/1-out) has a
  cross-floor secondary input at `(0,0,+1)` — three output variants
  (Straight/Default/Mirrored). `trace(bp)` spans all floors via
  `_occupancy_3d`, resolving L+1 belt→stacker connections through the 3-D
  occupancy; verified on a synthetic closed fixture (2 inputs, 1 output per
  stacker) and both open stacker fixtures (4 straight, 8 bent).
  Includes `isomorphic(a, b)` for structural netlist comparison (WP-A done).
  **WP-J lift calibration:** `lift_inout(type, r)` returns `(ins, outs, delta)`
  for all 16 lift variants (Lift1/Lift2 × Up/Down × Forward/Backward/Left/
  LeftMirrored), calibrated empirically from 20+ existing blueprints.
  `_lift_footprint` expands lifts to multi-floor cells (input at entity layer,
  output at target layer, blockers in between). `_occupancy` and `_occupancy_3d`
  handle lift cells; `_Cell.out_layer_delta` enables `trace()` to follow
  cross-floor output. `kind()` returns `"lift"` for lift entities (excluded from
  nodes, contracted like belts). Verified: **12-to-12 Balancer** (pure routing +
  46 lifts, 3 floors) lifts at **0 unmatched legs** on all floors; 3-D trace
  recovers 32 port nodes (16 in, 16 out) + 148 edges, all platform_in→platform_out.
  **WP-K hop tracing:** `_resolve_hops` pairs interior launcher/catcher entities
  by scanning along the sender's facing direction (first receiver with same
  rotation wins); senders sorted by `(rotation, projected position)` so
  within each direction the sender whose items reach receivers first is
  processed first — fixes greedy pairing when multiple senders face the same
  way. `trace_layer(..., contract_hops=True)` threads belt contraction
  through hop pairs transparently. Verified: 145/145 Half Splitter pairs,
  18/18 swap_diagonal pairs.
- `shapes.py` — **multi-layer** shape model + absolute ops (rotate / cut /
  half-destroy / swap-west / **stack**). Convention: quadrants `(NE, SE, SW, NW)`,
  west = `SW+NW`, layers separated by `:`. **Gravity** (orthogonal adjacency,
  connected groups fall as units) implemented for the stacker; diagonal quadrant
  pairs (NE↔SW, NW↔SE) are not connected and fall independently.
- `interpret.py` — pushes shapes through a lifted netlist, **per cell** via the
  netlist's `port_edges`, so multi-port machines work. Verified: rotators +
  half-destroyer on every lane (quarter + full belt's 48), the **cutter** (1→2,
  east/west), and the **swapper** (2→2) including the **diagonal trick**
  (north-only + south-only in → the two diagonals out). **`collect` mode** for
  throughput blueprints: sinks fed by multiple distinct shapes return a
  `frozenset[Shape]` instead of raising. **`classify_sources(nl)`** partitions
  sources into feed groups via 2-coloring the swapper constraint graph.
  Full-blueprint functional drive on `swap_diagonal` (WP-H): 26 sinks, 17
  single-shape + 9 multi-shape (throughput mergers), all verified.
- `validate.py` — physical validator (WP-B done). Checks overlap, dangling legs,
  off-grid placement. Corpus sweep passes on all closed fixtures.
- `route.py` — **now a thin shell over `pathfinder.py`** (WP-I).
  `reroute_with_junctions` delegates to `pathfinder.strip_and_reroute`; the
  WP-C-era sequential-A\* fan machinery (`_route_split_chain` splitter comb,
  `_route_merge_chain` merger staircase, junction-placement heuristics,
  `_perp_reach` ordering) is **deleted** — PathFinder tree growth subsumes
  all of it. What remains: `strip_belts`, the A\* core (`route_astar`,
  `route_edge(s)`, `reroute_astar`), simple `route_fanout`/`route_fanin`,
  entity plumbing (`_all_entities`, `_rebuild_blueprint`,
  `entities_to_blueprint`), and the WP-C history in §7.2.
- `pathfinder.py` — **WP-I done.** PathFinder negotiated-congestion router
  (McMurchie & Ebeling 1995). Routes multi-terminal nets as Steiner trees
  (farthest-first growth, per-cell leg-legality, junctions emerge from tree
  branching) under iterative congestion pricing with rip-up-and-reroute.
  Emit table is the programmatic inverse of `lift.routing_inout` (one shared
  calibration table, both directions). **Gate flipped:** `cutter_12_to_24`
  (66/66 edges) and `swap_diagonal` (162/162 edges) both round-trip through
  lift as isomorphic; single-cell corpus parity holds (all 7 fixtures).
  **WP-K hop routing:** `RoutingGraph(hop_range=N)` enables launcher/catcher
  hop edges (cost = `d·BASE + HOP_PENALTY`, strictly more expensive than
  walking — only congestion tips the balance). Hop endpoint cells emit
  `BeltPortSender/ReceiverInternalVariant`; flight cells are free.
  **Hop direction constraints:** sender approach (must be fed from opposite
  the hop), receiver exit (must continue in hop direction), terminal exit
  (hops landing on terminals must match the boundary edge direction toward
  the downstream machine/sink), no double-hop (receiver can't launch),
  root approach (seeds cell\_approach from port offset). `_resolve_hops`
  sorts senders by `(rotation, projected position)` for deterministic
  pairing. Single-floor topological crossings now route and round-trip.
  **A\* heuristic:** `_grow_tree` uses `manhattan(cell, terminal) × BASE`
  as an admissible heuristic, pruning exploration on large grids (3.9×
  speedup on the 2×4 diagonal). Platform bounds from `platforms.json`
  replace the fixed-margin bounding box for the passable set.
  **WP-J lift routing:** `RoutingGraph(lift_enabled=True)` enables vertical
  lift edges in Dijkstra (cost = `LIFT_COST = 3.0`, both cells occupied).
  `_lift_emit_table` inverts `lift.lift_inout` for all 16 variants × 4
  rotations. `_cell_to_entity` detects lift edges and emits the correct lift
  variant based on entry direction, exit direction, and layer delta.
  `Net.lift_edges` tracks cross-floor tree edges. Verified: two crossing nets
  on a 5×5×2 grid route successfully with lifts; fails without.
  **All failure paths raise `RoutingError`** (carrying overused cells for
  WP-M feedback): non-convergence at `MAX_ITERS`, unreachable terminals, leg patterns
  with no emit-table entry, and a root stuck on its port cell. Roots
  offset from a port are pre-seeded with the pending boundary in-leg so
  splitters/mergers can sit directly adjacent to ports (tight-fan regime).
  **Direct machine-to-machine couplings** (terminal still on a machine cell,
  e.g. rotator→adjacent swapper) are filtered out before routing — physical
  adjacency realizes those edges, lift re-derives them. N→M net components
  raise `NotImplementedError` loudly. 18 tests in `tests/test_pathfinder.py`.
- `place.py` — CP-SAT placement (WP-D done for rotator quarter + multi-cell
  machines). OR-Tools CP-SAT solver assigns `(x, y, rotation)` to machines given
  an abstract netlist (graph structure only, no coordinates) and a platform.
  Constraints: no overlap, interior bounds, rotation facing toward connected
  nodes, fan-out groups at adjacent x / ordered by source x, sink port
  ordering matched to source flow. **WP-M row model:** `_compute_stages()`
  assigns each machine a BFS depth from sources; all machines at the same
  stage share a single `row_y` variable. Routing channels between rows
  (and between ports and the nearest row) have minimum height 2 cells.
  The hand-tuned y-stagger, 2-cell port-row margin, and per-group same-y
  constraints are **deleted** — their effects emerge from the row model.
  **Multi-cell machines** (swapper, cutter): second-cell position via
  `add_element` on rotation-indexed offset tables; both cells in AllDifferent
  + bounds; second-cell wire length in objective; proximity-based port
  assignment in `_build_netlist` (`_assign_ports`); BFS-based sink ordering
  (`_trace_all_sinks`) handles multi-input machines correctly. Routes
  **16/16** rotator edges and **8/8** swapper edges.
  `abstract_netlist(nl)` strips coordinates from a lifted netlist for the
  solver. Accepts `forbidden` cells for WP-M feedback loop.
  **Density constraints:** per channel, per x-bucket of width 4, the number
  of nets whose horizontal interval covers the bucket is capped at the
  channel height (`_covers_bucket` reifies interval-covers-bucket for
  const/var endpoints). Row-balance objective term centers rows between the
  source and sink channels.
  **WP-M multi-face ports (Half Splitter gate, slice 1):** `platform_in`/
  `platform_out` nodes may carry an optional `"face"` key (0=west, 1=south,
  2=east, 3=north; default `SOURCE_FACE`=1 for sources, `SINK_FACE`=3 for
  sinks since the 2026-06-11 south-flow convention) to land on a
  non-default platform edge. `_port_rotation_for(face, kind)` derives the
  port entity's belt rotation — `face` for sources (the calibrated
  into-interior direction), `(face+2)%4` for sinks (continuing outward) —
  generalizing the old single global `port_rotation`. Extra-face ports are
  assigned sequentially from `_edge_ports(plat, face)`, independent of the
  row model; primary-face (`SOURCE_FACE`=1 south / `SINK_FACE`=3 north,
  since 2026-06-11) ports keep the existing row-model + WP-L
  monotone sink ordering. Verified end-to-end: a rotator with a west-face
  (and separately east-face) sink places, routes, and lifts isomorphic.
  **CutterDefault composes with multi-face ports out of the box:** a single
  `CutterDefaultInternalVariant` (1-in/2-out, `_is_multi_cell` already true)
  feeding one south-face sink and one west-face sink places, routes, lifts
  isomorphic, and `interpret` recovers the correct `shapes.cut` east/west
  halves on the correctly-faced sinks — no placer changes needed
  (`tests/test_place.py::TestCutterDefault`). De-risks the Half Splitter's
  per-lane cutter fan.
  **`side_regions(plat)` (2026-06-10):** derives the Half Splitter's
  `western_faces`/`eastern_faces` group lists generically for any platform —
  every west-face (0) group + the west-most half of north-face (3) groups
  (mirrored for east/face 2), matching the hand-derived `Foundation_2x4`
  example exactly (`tests/test_place.py::TestPinnedPorts::test_half_splitter_regions_on_2x4`).
  **Stance change (2026-06-11): the placer is on the critical path, no
  longer scaffolding.** Its hard no-crossing constraints contradict any
  crossing-rich spec (CP-SAT proves the representative Half Splitter
  topology INFEASIBLE — §2a "Gate-2 blockers"). WP-N changes its contract
  to "crossing demand ≤ routing capacity"; the router pays for crossings
  with hops/lifts. Placement and routing now share the critical path,
  coupled through the crossing budget.
- `synth.py` — spec-driven synthesis (WP-E + WP-L + WP-M). `Spec(op, platform,
  throughput)` where `op` is a single operation or a tuple of operations forming
  a **series chain**: each lane's source feeds `throughput` parallel paths, each
  path passing through every stage in order, then fan-in to the sink.
  `_lower(abstract, platform)` runs the generic pipeline (any abstract netlist →
  **monotone sort** → place → route → blueprint). **WP-M feedback loop:**
  `_lower` catches `RoutingError`, adds the overused cells to a `forbidden` set,
  and retries placement up to 3 times. **WP-L monotone assignment:**
  `_monotone_sort` reorders source/sink nodes by ascending x so the placer
  assigns leftmost sources to leftmost ports, eliminating route crossings for
  uniform specs. `abstract_netlist()` now carries `orig_x` on port nodes so
  lifted netlists sort correctly. **WP-L quotient fast path:**
  `synthesize_quotient(spec)` synthesizes one floor and stamps it across all
  three floors via `generator.stamp` — belt counts scale exactly 3×, each floor
  isomorphic. Verified: single-op rotate-180/cw/ccw on 1×1 quarter (isomorphic
  to oracles, 16/16 edges); half-destroy (validates + interprets at throughput=2
  **and throughput=3**); series chains (2×CW = 180°, 3×CCW = CW, both validate
  + interpret correctly); **series with throughput=2** (4×2×2 = 16 machines,
  validates + interprets correctly — the WP-D xfail now passes).
  Multi-cell: 2-swapper abstract netlists lower to valid blueprints that interpret
  correctly (placement + routing + port assignment verified end-to-end).
  **Diagonal trick synthesis:** `DiagonalSpec(pairs, platform)` generates the
  paired north/south → swapper → diagonal topology; `synthesize_diagonal()`
  lowers it through the full pipeline. Verified on 1×1 with 2 pairs (8/8 edges),
  **on 2×2 with 4 pairs** (16/16 edges), **and on 2×4 with 8 pairs** (32/32
  edges, validates, interprets to correct diagonals on all 16 lanes, with
  hop\_range=4 — the **first north-star gate**).
  CLI: `synth swap_diagonal [--pairs N] [--platform P]`.
  Reference: `data/reference/swap_diagonal_4pair_2x2.spz2bp`.
  **Cutter fan synthesis (2026-06-10):** `CutterSpec(lanes, platform)`
  generates the per-lane `src → CutterDefault → (sink_w, sink_e)` topology,
  with `sink_w`/`sink_e` `Region`-pinned to `side_regions(plat)`'s western/
  eastern groups — the Half Splitter's per-lane fan + side semantics.
  `synthesize_cutter()` lowers it through the full pipeline. Verified: 1 lane
  on `Foundation_1x1` with `hop_range=0` (0 unmatched legs, `interpret`
  recovers the correct west/east halves on the matching faces); **4 lanes on
  `Foundation_2x4` with `hop_range=4`** (0 unmatched legs, all 8 sinks land
  in their `Region` with the correct half,
  `tests/test_synth.py::TestCutterSynthesize`); **16 lanes on
  `Foundation_2x4` with `hop_range=8`** (north-star gate 2, 0 unmatched legs,
  all 32 sinks land in their `Region` with the correct half,
  `test_synth_half_splitter_2x4`, ~12-17s).
  **268 total tests, 0 xfail.**
- CLI: `gen`, `diff`, `show`, `lift`, `viz`, `place`, `synth`. `synth` synthesizes
  a blueprint from a spec (e.g. `synth rotate_180` or `synth rotate_cw,rotate_cw`).
  `viz` renders a blueprint as HTML/SVG (belts as directional lines,
  machines/ports as filled rectangles, failed edges as dashed red overlays;
  `--open` launches a browser). `place` runs the full abstract→place→route
  pipeline on a blueprint and writes the result. `data/reference/` holds oracle
  fixtures and `*_font.spz2bp` copies with font-based silk screening for
  comparison.

**WP-A and WP-B: DONE.** Netlist isomorphism via networkx graph comparison; physical
validator with corpus sweep. Both green.

**WP-C (routing): SUPERSEDED BY WP-I.** WP-C's sequential A\* with junction
placement heuristics carried the project to cell-granularity multi-cell ports
(`_node_cell_ports`) and spacious wide fans, but its precisely-diagnosed
blocker — tight 2D fan packing, where greedy obstacle-marking A\* congests —
is exactly what WP-I's negotiated congestion solves. The WP-C fan machinery
(combs, staircases, placement heuristics) is deleted; `reroute_with_junctions`
delegates to `pathfinder.strip_and_reroute`. **All 9 corpus fixtures (7
single-cell + cutter_12_to_24 + swap_diagonal) round-trip isomorphic.** The
WP-C section in §7.2 is kept as the historical record.

**Cutter + swapper: SOLVED (the cutter was the blocker).** Machines now expand to
footprints (`_machine_footprint`); each is one entity + a second cell to the
right of flow (Default) / left (Mirrored):
- **Cutter** (1-in/2-out): second cell output-only — pass-by belts don't connect.
  Dense `12→24` lifts at **0 unmatched legs** (16 cutters × in-1/out-2).
- **Swapper** (2-in/2-out): second cell mirrors the anchor. Determined **without a
  belted template** — brute-forced against `Swap Diagonal`, which lifts at **0
  unmatched legs** (32 swappers × in-2/out-2). So the **diagonal extractor's
  topology is lifted** (the north-star demo, structurally).

`tests/test_lift.py::TestCutter`/`TestSwapper`. See `docs/machines.md`,
`QUESTIONS.md` Q1.

**Rung 2 (interpret) — DONE, including full-blueprint drive.** The interpreter is
port-aware (`Node.rotation`, `Netlist.port_edges`, per-cell propagation); the
cutter/swapper ops + the diagonal trick are verified on hand-built netlists
(`tests/test_interpret.py::TestMultiPort`). **Full-blueprint drive (WP-H):** the
entire `swap_diagonal` blueprint (26 sources, 26 sinks, 32 swappers, 48 rotators)
runs end-to-end with `collect=True`. With uniform input S, single-feed sinks
produce `{S}` and throughput-merged sinks produce `{S, CW(S)}` — 17 + 9 = 26
sinks verified. `classify_sources(nl)` partitions the 26 sources into two swapper
feed groups (9 + 8) plus 9 pass-throughs via 2-coloring the constraint graph.

**Critical path — complete through WP-E + WP-I + WP-J + WP-L; WP-M in progress.**
~~WP-A~~ ✓ → ~~WP-B~~ ✓ → ~~WP-C~~ ✓ → ~~**WP-D placement**~~ ✓ →
~~**WP-E synthesize**~~ ✓ → ~~**WP-I PathFinder**~~ ✓ → ~~**WP-J lifts**~~ ✓ →
~~**WP-L assignment**~~ ✓ → **WP-M row placement** (row model + feedback loop
landed; hop direction constraints landed; A\* heuristic landed; **first
north-star gate passes** — `test_synth_diagonal_full_belt_2x4`; Half Splitter
gate remaining).
`synth.py` runs the full pipeline: spec → abstract netlist → monotone sort →
place → route → blueprint, with a feedback retry loop on routing failure.
Verified: rotate-180/cw/ccw on 1×1 quarter (**isomorphic to oracles**, 16/16
edges each), half-destroy on 1×1 (validates + interprets at throughput=2
**and throughput=3**), series chains with throughput=2 (**16 machines on 1×1,
the former xfail**), **8-pair diagonal on 2×4 with hops (32/32 edges,
validates + interprets)**. CLI: `just run synth rotate_180 -o out.spz2bp`.

**Remaining gaps:**
- ~~The tight 2D merger packing (cutter/swapper xfails)~~ — **resolved by WP-I**
  (PathFinder negotiated-congestion router). Both multi-cell corpus fixtures
  now round-trip at full edge count.
- ~~**The diagonal extractor**~~ (north-star demo): **first gate passes.**
  `test_synth_diagonal_full_belt_2x4` — 8 pairs on Foundation_2x4 with
  hop\_range=4, 32/32 edges, validates, interprets to correct diagonals on
  all 16 lanes (0.6s with A\* heuristic). Scales from 2 pairs on 1×1 through
  4 pairs on 2×2 to 8 pairs on 2×4.
- **Platform calibration done (2026-06-05).** User provided 13 empty
  templates (TEMPLATES/ in the blueprints repo) with `BeltPortReceiverInternalVariant`
  on every IO port slot. Port slots are **bidirectional** (Receiver = source,
  Sender = sink). Ground-truth port positions added to `platforms.json` for all
  13 Foundation types; `place.py` reads positions from the `ports` list.
  Foundation_1x2 geometry corrected (was [1,2], now [2,1]). New types:
  Foundation_1x3, 2x3, 3x3, C5 (cross), L3 (short L), L4 (long L), S4, T4.
- **Gate 2 reopened at the representative topology** (4 cutters/lane,
  `hop_range=5`): CP-SAT placement INFEASIBLE. Root cause in §2a "Gate-2
  blockers"; ordered fix plan in **WP-N (§7.2)**. The old "placer is
  scaffolding" stance is retired — placement is on the critical path.
- Machine-type breadth work (stacker WP-F, painter WP-G, full-blueprint sim
  WP-H) blocks nothing on the diagonal extractor — its machines (rotators,
  swappers, belts) are already lifted and simulated.

## 1. What we know (verified against the corpus)

### Format & codec
- Envelope `SHAPEZ2-4-<base64(gzip(JSON))>$`; game `V=1137`.
- Two-level nesting: Island `BP.Entries` = platforms → each platform `.B.Entries`
  = buildings in platform-local coordinates.
- Building entry `{X, Y, R, L, T}` (R rotation 0–3, L layer 0–2, both omitted when 0).
- **Codec is faithful**: decode→encode reproduces the decompressed JSON
  byte-for-byte (only the gzip mtime differs). No codec work needed.

### Tile-replication family (lane-preserving 1×1→1×4 belt ops)
- Atom = **one floor of a quarter = 80 functional entities**.
- **Floors are exact duplicates** (only a cosmetic `Label` differs on L0); each
  floor is a self-contained 2-D circuit — **no lifts in this family**.
- **Full belt = 4× quarter, exactly**, at coordinate pitch 20. Verified for
  rotators *and* half-destroyers *and* speed-readers (all 4×).
- **CW/CCW = the 180 tile with only the rotator building type swapped**; the only
  per-direction wrapper difference is the island icon
  (`RotatorHalfVariant`/`RotatorOneQuadVariant`/`RotatorOneQuadCCWVariant`).

### Split/merge are belt junctions, not machines
- Shapez has no merger/splitter *building*: a "junction" is just a **belt cell
  with an extra leg** (a T/X). Whether it splits or merges is only the flow
  direction — legs sticking *out* = split (1 in / 2 out, `Splitter1To2L`), legs
  sticking *in* = merge (2 in / 1 out, `Merger2To1L`). Same geometry, reversed flow.
- A junction is general — any in/out split over ≤4 legs. Corpus routing variants:
  merges `2To1L`(+mir) / `3To1` / `TShape`, splits `1To2L`(+mir) / `1To3` / `TShape`,
  1/1 belts `Forward` / `Left`(+mir), plus `BeltFilter`(+mir) (routes by shape — a
  predicate) and `BeltReader`(+mir) (emits a wire signal). ~15 variants.
- They belong to the **routing layer** alongside straight and turn belts.
  Operation nodes in the netlist are only the actual machines (rotators, cutters…).
- **Lift's belt-direction calibration is this table**: each variant × R →
  (input sides, output sides). The tracer must handle arbitrary fan-in/fan-out.

### Belt-direction model (calibrated for the rotator family)
- Convention: **+1 in R = 90° CCW**. Each routing variant has fixed input/output
  sides at R=0, rotated by R (Forward: in=back / out=front; turns: out = one
  perpendicular; junctions: the multi-leg pattern).
- Validated on the rotator quarter: **0 unmatched legs**, and `lift.trace_layer`
  recovers its exact netlist (4 inputs each split to 2 rotators, 8 rotators each
  merge to 1 output) — and the full belt as 4× that. See `lift.py`.
- Calibrated (0 unmatched legs on the rotator quarter *and* the half-destroyer):
  all routing variants — Forward / Left(+mir) / Filter / Reader, `Splitter`
  `1To2L`(+mir)/`1To3`/`TShape`, `Merger` `2To1L`(+mir)/`3To1`/`TShape`, ports,
  rotator, and the **cutter** (one entity + an output-only second cell, 1→2 — the
  dense `12→24` blueprint lifts at 0 unmatched legs). Remaining gap: the swapper
  (2→2), stacker (2→1), and painter (needs a pipe routing layer).

### Shapes have absolute orientation
- A shape's orientation is fixed in **world** space — north is always north.
- Cut / swap / half-destroy act on the **absolute** west/east halves regardless of
  building rotation; rotating those buildings only re-routes belts, not function.
  **Only a Rotator re-orients a shape.**
- So to reach a non-west part you rotate the shape west, apply the op, rotate back
  — which is why extractors are dominated by rotators (they are *addressing*).
- This is a **simulator** fact (Rungs 2/4); it does not affect the belt-topology
  lift (ports still rotate with `R`). Detail in `docs/machines.md`.

### Decoration is per-blueprint signage
- `Trash` spells pixel-art names (e.g. "180"/"CW"/"CCW") on the rotators' L0 —
  ad-hoc, not systematic, and absent from most families.
- **`Trash` is functional in the Trash family.** So decoration detection must be
  **family/position-aware, never type-based** (a current latent bug in
  `DECORATION_TYPES`).

### Platform geometry (seam model) — see `data/platforms.json`
- Each unit is 20×20 bounding / 16×16 buildable (2-cell border). **Joining units
  fills the shared border: +4 cells per internal seam.**
- Interior = `20·units − 4` per axis. Verified: 1×1 = 16×16 (corpus), 1×4 = 76×16
  (M2). Generalizes to any size (2×4 = 76×36, 2×8, …).
- `platforms.json` carries ground-truth `ports` lists (all 13 Foundation types
  calibrated from templates, 2026-06-05). Port slots are bidirectional
  `BeltPortReceiverInternalVariant`; direction is determined by entity type
  (Receiver = source, Sender = sink). 4 ports per exposed unit-edge face.
  Foundation_1x2 geometry corrected (was [1,2], now [2,1]).

### Per-family parametrics (reference)
- Lane-preserving belt ops: **12 in / 12 out** (quarter), **48 / 48** (full belt).
- Lane-changing (cut 12→24), multi-input (stack/swap → 2×4/2×2), and fluid ops
  (painter/crystallizer/miner) have operation-specific port counts and platforms.
- Diagonal extractors are routing-dominated: e.g. `Full Belt Shape to Upper Left
  Diagonal` on a 2×4 is in=48, out=96, with **3456 belts** — ~95% routing.

### Composition
- A composite ("destroy west half **then** rotate 180") is a pipeline of named ops.
- Valid when lane signatures line up (12→12 | 12→12).
- Two lowerings of the same spec: **chain of platforms** (space-belt connected —
  easy) vs **co-placed on one platform** (place-and-route — the goal).

---

## 2. Architecture (the real target)

- **Netlist IR** — a directed dataflow graph. Nodes = operations with typed ports,
  lane signatures, throughput; edges = nets; output ports may be *pinned* to
  specific physical positions. Placement-free.
- **Lowering** — netlist → placement (cell, layer, rotation per building) →
  routing (3-D belts with Forward/Left/Left-Mirrored turn-typing, lifts as vias,
  throughput-aware) → entities → file.
- **Simulator** — push shapes through the netlist (does it compute the spec?) plus
  a physical validator (no overlaps, ports connect, on legal cells).
- Tile-replication is the **degenerate case**: one fixed placement, straight-lane
  routing, lane-preserving. It exercises the whole I/O + verification loop.

---

## 2a. Scaling architecture — dense platforms (added 2026-06-09)

How place-and-route reaches the real targets: ~50–150 nets (48 input belts →
12–16 machines → 96 output belts) crossing each other across a 76×36×3-floor
interior. This section is the *why*; the implementable detail is WP-I…WP-M in
§7.2. Read this section before touching any of those WPs.

### Why the current router cannot get there

`route.py` is sequential A\* with hard obstacle marking. Two structural limits:

1. **Net ordering.** Each laid route permanently claims cells with no
   knowledge of later nets, so route #40 of 96 finds its corridor walled off.
   For congested instances **no ordering succeeds** — feasibility requires
   nets to mutually compromise, which a one-pass greedy scheme cannot express.
   The cutter/swapper corpus xfails are this failure at small scale; adding
   more ordering heuristics (we already have three) only moves the cliff.
2. **No crossing capacity.** One-occupant-per-cell on a single floor makes
   crossings impossible by construction — there is no 2-in/2-out belt cell
   (§1: junction variants are 1→2, 1→3, 2→1, 3→1, T). Yet the platform
   physically offers crossing capacity: 3 floors joined by lift entities
   (`Lift1Up*`/`Lift1Down*`), and launcher→catcher hops
   (`BeltPortSenderVariant`/`BeltPortReceiverVariant`) that fly over cells.
   Dense human builds spend that capacity freely; the router cannot express
   any of it.

### The fix (standard chip-CAD, sized for us)

This problem is FPGA detailed routing, which is solved at 1000× our scale by
**negotiated-congestion routing** (PathFinder, McMurchie & Ebeling 1995; the
VPR router): route every net optimally *allowing overlaps*, then iteratively
re-price shared cells and rip-up-and-reroute until no cell is shared. Nets
negotiate — a net with a cheap alternative vacates a contested cell; a net
without one pays the price and keeps it. VPR routes 100k+ nets this way; we
have ~150 on ~8k cells × 3 floors.

A giant co-formulated CP-SAT model (placement + routing together) stays
**rejected** (the chicken-egg decision): cell-level multi-commodity flow here
is ~3M booleans, and it discards the negotiation structure that makes
PathFinder converge. CP-SAT's jobs are assignment (WP-L) and
capacity-constrained placement (WP-M) — never the routing grid itself.

### Pipeline

```
abstract netlist
 → lane / instance assignment     WP-L  kill crossings before they exist; quotient symmetric lanes
 → placement w/ channel capacity  WP-M  rows + belt channels, CP-SAT, routability-aware
 → detailed routing               WP-I  PathFinder negotiated congestion …
     … on the unified 3-D graph   WP-J  floors + lifts      WP-K  launcher hops
 → emit                           existing  junction typing via the calibration table
 → verify                         existing  lift→isomorphic (I4) · interpret (I3/I5) · validate (I6)
```

The verification loop is untouched and is what makes the rebuild safe: routed
output is never eyeballed — it is lifted back and graph-compared (I4). Emit
must keep producing exactly the types+rotations `lift.routing_inout` decodes
(single shared calibration table, both directions).

### The unified routing graph (the key data structure)

One graph encodes all the physics, so the router needs no special-case
crossing logic — going over (lift), flying over (hop), and detouring around
become the same decision under one cost model:

- **Nodes:** cells `(x, y, layer)`, layer ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Capacity = 1 net per
  cell. Machine-occupied cells are not nodes.
- **Step edges:** 4-adjacent same-layer cells, cost 1.0.
- **Lift edges (WP-J):** between adjacent layers via lift entities, cost
  ≈ 3.0; claiming one claims a cell on **both** layers. Geometry must be
  calibrated from a fixture first (QUESTIONS.md Q8).
- **Hop edges (WP-K):** launcher → catcher, straight line, same layer, cost
  ≈ 2.0 + 0.05·distance; **flight cells are not occupied** (or lane-limited —
  per Q7 calibration). Endpoints each occupy one cell.
- **Legal leg patterns per cell:** (1 in, 1 out), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1),
  (3, 1) — exactly the junction variant table. Max 4 legs. Never 2-in/2-out.

### Concrete north-star instance: the Half Splitter (added 2026-06-09)

The user's hand build exists, unfinished, at
`~/Projects/shapez_2_blueprints/UNFINISHED Half Splitter.spz2bp` — it is both
the demand signal and the partial oracle. Functional spec, as stated:

- **Input:** 48 full-shape belts entering across the **four south port faces**
  (4 faces × 4 slots × 3 floors = 48 lanes).
- **Operation:** cut every shape into its west half and east half (the
  absolute-halves cutter — `CutterDefault`, 1-in/2-out).
- **Output routing (the hard part):** 48 west-half belts must exit on the
  **western faces** (the 2 W-edge faces + the two west-most north faces) and
  48 east-half belts on the **eastern faces** (the 2 E-edge faces + the two
  east-most north faces). That side semantics is part of the spec. What is
  relaxed — see "Spec relaxation" below — is the slot-level assignment
  *within* each side, which the optimizer owns.
- **Port arithmetic — CONFIRMED (2026-06-09, mined from the blueprint):**
  platform is `Foundation_2x4` (8 non-south faces = 4 north + 2 west + 2
  east). The build is **entirely on layer 0** (all 1562 entities): 16 input
  lanes (S faces) → 32 output lanes per floor; the hand plan was the
  tile-replication convention — duplicate the floor ×3 for 48→96 (a **floor
  quotient**, the same instance-shrinking move as WP-L's lane quotient).
  Per the spec relaxation below, that is a baseline strategy, not the target.
- **Machine arithmetic (complete in the build):** per input lane: 1→4
  splitter tree (3 × `Splitter1To2L`) → **4 cutters** (cutter rate = ¼ belt)
  → two 4→1 merger trees (6 × `Merger2To1L`, 3 per half). 16 lanes ⇒ 48
  splitters + 64 cutters + 96 mergers, all present and all locally routed
  (every cutter has its input and reaches an output).
- **The human's crossing mechanism — hops, not floors:** zero lifts; **145
  launcher→catcher pairs on one floor** (`BeltPortSenderInternalVariant` →
  `BeltPortReceiverInternalVariant`, the same types as edge port slots —
  interior position is what distinguishes a hop endpoint from platform IO).
  Mined hop physics (feeds Q7): pairing is **first receiver along the
  sender's facing ray with the same rotation** (all 145 pairs resolve);
  flight distances observed 1–5 cells; flights pass over belts and over other
  hop endpoints but **never over machine cells** (0 of 280 flight cells);
  up to **3 flights stack** over one ground cell. Hops are clearly cheap —
  the synthesizer's `HOP_COST` should not penalize them much.
- **What is unfinished (the demand signal):** 17 of 32 outputs are fed. All
  eastern-lane **west halves** — which must traverse ~60 cells across the
  whole platform over everything else — are unrouted, plus parts of the
  north-face fan-in. The human completed every local route and stopped at
  exactly the maximal-crossing hauls. That is the regime WP-I + WP-K must
  win at.
- **Spec relaxation (2026-06-09, user decision).** Two properties of the hand
  build are *artifacts of hand design*, not requirements — do not imitate
  them:
  1. **Output ports are Region-constrained, not slot-pinned** (corrected
     2026-06-09 — an earlier draft of this item said `Free`, which
     over-relaxed: the side semantics *is* the spec). West-half sinks carry
     `Region(western_faces)`, east-half sinks `Region(eastern_faces)` — each
     region a named set of port-`Group`s (§5 pinning levels); face purity
     follows from the regions being disjoint. What the hand build
     over-specified — and what the optimizer now owns — is the **slot-level
     assignment within each region**: which lane lands on which
     face/slot/floor of its side. Hard `Locked` pins remain available for
     factory-integration cases.
  2. **Single-floor + copy-paste layers is a hand convenience.** Humans build
     one floor and duplicate it because hand-routing in 3-D is miserable; the
     optimizer has no such excuse. Full 3-D routing — lifts, non-identical
     floors, cross-floor paths — is sanctioned and expected (**WP-J is on
     this instance's critical path after all**). The floor quotient (route
     one floor at 16→32, stamp ×3) is demoted to an optional baseline: cheap
     to compute, useful as an I7 reference point and as a fallback when full
     3-D search struggles, but not the target strategy.
- **Role in the plan:** this is the acceptance instance for the full scaling
  arc — WP-M's north-star gate (`test_synth_half_splitter_2x4`, alongside the
  diagonal extractor). Lifting the unfinished build (even partially routed) is
  also a corpus stress test for WP-I: its completed regions are tight-packed
  fan trees.

### Gate-2 blockers found via viz review (2026-06-11)

Visualizing gate 2's output (`CutterSpec(lanes=16, "Foundation_2x4")`,
`hop_range=8`) surfaced two problems. Gate 2 still passes I4/I5/I6
(round-trip, validation, region+half correctness) — neither problem is
caught by the structural tests — but both **block treating gate 2 as
representative of the real Half Splitter**, as opposed to a topology/
region-pinning proof.

1. **Hop range exceeds the in-game limit.** Launcher→catcher hops are capped
   at **1–4 blank (flight) tiles between** sender and receiver (QUESTIONS.md
   Q7). In `pathfinder.py` terms, `hdist` (sender-cell to receiver-cell
   distance, the loop in `_grow_tree` is `range(2, hop_range + 1)`) equals
   `blank_tiles + 1`, so the legal range is `hdist ∈ [2, 5]` ⇒ **`hop_range`
   must be ≤ 5**, not the `8` gate 2 uses. Lift/interpret/validate enforce no
   hop-distance limit, so gate 2 can emit hops that would not place in-game.
   **Done (2026-06-11):** added `lift.MAX_HOP_RANGE = 5`; `RoutingGraph`
   raises if `hop_range` exceeds it, `_resolve_hops`'s pairing search is
   bounded by it, and gate 2 now uses `hop_range=MAX_HOP_RANGE`. **Outcome:**
   gate 2 is flaky at this legal cap (3/4 runs pass, 1/4 fails with 3
   overused cells at `MAX_ITERS=60`) — a real feasibility finding at the
   placeholder topology's scale, deferred until blocker 2 below is fixed
   (see §0 status).
2. **Gate 2 has 4× too few cutters.** The "Machine arithmetic" above
   (confirmed from the human build) requires **4 cutters per input lane**
   (cutter throughput = ¼ belt) via a 1→4 splitter tree and two 4→1 merger
   trees (one per half) — 16 lanes ⇒ 64 cutters/floor, 192 across the 3-floor
   design. `CutterSpec`/`netlist_from_cutter_spec` currently synthesizes
   **1 cutter per lane** (`src_i -> cut_i -> {sink_i_w, sink_i_e}`, 4
   nodes/lane) — this proved region pinning and multi-face ports but is not
   throughput-correct. The real per-lane topology is `src_i -> [1→4 split
   tree] -> 4×cut -> [4→1 merge tree]×2 -> {sink_i_w, sink_i_e}` — 16
   nodes/lane, 256 nodes at 16 lanes (vs. 64 today). Routing/placement
   feasibility at this scale, especially combined with blocker 1's tighter
   hop cap, is **unverified** and is the real remaining work before gate 2
   can stand in for the Half Splitter.
   **Done (2026-06-11):** added `CutterSpec.cutters_per_lane` (default 1);
   `cutters_per_lane=4` emits `src_i -> cut{i}_{j} -> {sink_i_w, sink_i_e}`
   for `j in 0..3` — a 1→4 split (shared `src_i`, 4 edges) and two 4→1
   merges (4 edges into each of `sink_i_w`/`sink_i_e`), all as plain edges
   sharing nodes (no new node kinds). Lift/interpret need **no changes**:
   `test_single_lane_four_cutters_halves_land_on_correct_sides` (1 lane,
   `Foundation_1x1`, `hop_range=5`) validates end-to-end with 0 unmatched
   legs and correct west/east halves. **Outcome: a harder, deterministic
   blocker, not the predicted tuning problem.** As soon as a *second* lane
   is added with `cutters_per_lane >= 2`, **CP-SAT placement itself becomes
   INFEASIBLE** — reproducible in <1s, independent of `PYTHONHASHSEED` and
   process (i.e. a real model contradiction, not solver flakiness). Checked:
   `lanes=1` always feasible for `cutters_per_lane` 1, 3, 4 (infeasible only
   for exactly 2 — a `len(machine_members)==2` adjacency constraint, see
   below); `lanes>=2` is infeasible for every `cutters_per_lane>=2` tried
   (2, 3, 4) on both `Foundation_1x1` and `Foundation_2x4`, including the
   4-lane checkpoint and the 16-lane gate 2.

   **Root cause** (`place.py` ~lines 645–690, "Fan-group structure"): a
   fan-out group is the set of machines sharing a source (here, one lane's
   `cutters_per_lane` cutters fed by `src_i`). Two constraints assume each
   group routes onward in a *single shared direction*:
   - For exactly 2-member groups, `abs(m_x[a] - m_x[b]) == 1` (adjacent
     cells) — conflicts with the cutter-fan's per-cutter routes to *both* a
     west-Region sink and an east-Region sink (`lanes=1, cutters_per_lane=2`
     fails this way).
   - For groups with >=2 members, **cross-group ordering** requires lane
     *i*'s entire group to sit left of lane *i+1*'s entire group (by source
     x-position) — but every lane's group must route to *both* the
     west-Region sinks *and* the east-Region sinks, so two lanes' groups
     cannot be linearly ordered without one lane's west-bound (or
     east-bound) routes crossing the other's. CP-SAT correctly proves this
     infeasible.

   New tests `test_four_lane_four_cutters_2x4_halves_land_on_correct_sides`
   and `test_synth_half_splitter_2x4` (now `cutters_per_lane=4`) are marked
   `xfail(strict=True)` recording this. **Resolution plan: WP-N (§7.2).**
   The infeasibility is not a bug to patch constraint-by-constraint: the
   fan-group constraints encode "routes never cross" as *hard* constraints,
   and the Half Splitter *cannot* be routed without crossings — every
   lane's cutter bank feeds both Regions, the human build needed 145 hops
   and stopped hand-routing at exactly the maximal-crossing hauls. A
   no-crossing model *must* prove this spec infeasible; CP-SAT is being
   honest about a wrong question. WP-N changes the placer's contract:
   produce a geometry whose crossing demand fits the routing capacity
   (hops + lifts + channel slack — the crossing budget below), and let
   PathFinder pay for the crossings. A third structural problem found
   while planning WP-N: the row model puts all same-stage machines in one
   shared `row_y`, but 64 Mirrored cutters × 2 cells = 128 cells of width
   on a 76-cell-wide `Foundation_2x4` interior — at 16 lanes the cutter
   stage *cannot* be one row regardless of the fan-group constraints (the
   human layout is 16 lane-columns × 4 cutters stacked vertically).

### Crossing budget (cheap infeasibility check)

With `Locked`- or `Group`-pinned inputs and outputs, the minimum number of
route crossings is fixed by the **group-level permutation**'s inversion count
(slot assignment within a group is free and contributes no additional
crossings). Floors, lifts, hops, and channel heights give a computable
crossing capacity. Compare the two **before** solving anything: an impossible
spec is rejected with a counting argument and a clear message instead of a
solver timeout. (Built as part of WP-M.)

**`Group`/`Locked` sink pinning landed (2026-06-10) — unblocked.**
`place._assign_pinned_ports` honors `Locked`/`Group` pins independent of the
Free monotone reorder (`_trace_all_sinks` now skips already-pinned sinks); the
worked example — 4 input groups and 4 output groups (west→east) on
`Foundation_2x4`'s north/south faces, input group *i* `Group`-pinned to output
group `3-i` (0-indexed: a full reversal) — places correctly and
`group_inversions` reports 6 inversions for 4 groups
(`tests/test_place.py::TestPinnedPorts`).

**Capacity side landed (2026-06-13, WP-N task 3d).** Routed all 24
permutations of 4 groups on `Foundation_2x4` at `hop_range=5`, single floor.
All inversion counts (0–6) converge; occasional 1-cell failures at inv=4 are
nondeterministic (CP-SAT placement variance + router tie-breaking), not
capacity limits. Empirical capacity = C(n_groups, 2) = theoretical maximum.
`_check_crossing_budget()` extracts group pairs from group-pinned abstract
nodes, counts inversions via `group_inversions`, raises
`CrossingBudgetExceeded` if over capacity. Called at the top of `place()`.
Three new tests in `TestCrossingBudget`.

**`Region` sink pinning landed (2026-06-10).** `place._assign_pinned_ports`
now also handles `"pin": "region"`, `"target": [(face, group_index), ...]` —
the flattened slot pool of every listed group, assigned in node order, the
"thin wrapper" §5 anticipated. Verified on the Half Splitter's own regions:
`western_faces = [(0,0),(0,1),(3,0),(3,1)]` and
`eastern_faces = [(2,0),(2,1),(3,2),(3,3)]` on `Foundation_2x4` each yield 16
disjoint slots (`tests/test_place.py::TestPinnedPorts::test_half_splitter_regions_on_2x4`,
`test_region_pin_spans_multiple_groups`). Region names (`western_faces` etc.)
are not a stored concept — callers (synth/tests) pass the literal group-id
list; `place.py` stays structural. **Not yet wired into `synth.py`** — no
spec constructs `"pin": "region"` nodes yet, and WP-L's "Region sinks choose
both group and slot" output-port assignment (the monotone-within-region
ordering) remains open.

## 3. The ladder

Your hand-built library is the **oracle at every rung** — it supplies both the
spec library and the measuring stick.

- **Foundation — DONE.** Codec, `Entity` model, functional `diff`, seam-accurate
  geometry, corpus oracle. Tile-replication **M1** (quarter reproduced) and **M2**
  (full belt = 4× quarter, built from the quarter tile) verified.
- **Scaffolding — DESIGNED, not landed.** Single-op `generate_rotator` (180/cw/ccw
  × 1×1/1×4) + `gen`/`diff` CLI verbs; extend the tile family to half-destroyers
  and speed-readers. This is the regression floor, not the product.
- **Rung 1 — Lift (underway).** Decompile a placed blueprint into a netlist by
  tracing the oriented belt graph. All routing variants are calibrated; `lift.py`
  lifts the rotator family and the half-destroyer at 0 unmatched legs (see §1).
  Next: a **machine-definition table** (footprint + ports per type). The generic
  1-in/1-out "straight through" machine model holds only when belts sit on both
  ends; in dense packing it breaks — e.g. a rotator fed by a belt on its east and
  a cutter on its south has no west input at all. Cutters (1×2, 1 in / 2 out) and
  swappers (1×2, 2 in / 2 out) compound this: their belt-facing ports match, but
  the second output and machine-to-machine couplings don't, so downstream
  machines get dangling inputs. Derive footprints + ports per type from the pure
  blueprints by examining *all* neighbours (belts and machines), then the
  extractor lifts.
- **Rung 2 — Simulate.** Shape model + op transforms + physical validator. Makes
  "correct" mean *computes the function*, not *belts connect*. Needed in full only
  at Rung 4 — Rung 3 can defer it via structural validation (see below).
- **Rung 3 — Re-route a known netlist.** Strip the placement off a lifted example;
  have the router reproduce a **valid** (then **compact**) layout; measure against
  the human-optimal original. The first real place-and-route. Validity can be
  checked **structurally** — lift the routed output and assert graph-isomorphism
  back to the input netlist — so the shape simulator is not required here.
- **Rung 4 — Synthesize from spec.** "Extract both diagonals, pin to L/R outputs"
  → netlist → place-and-route. The product.

---

## 4. Acceptance

- Tile cases: functional-entity `diff` against the corpus oracle.
- Netlist cases: simulation equivalence to the spec.
- Routing: physical validity + functional equivalence; **compactness measured
  against the human oracle**.
- Final gate (manual): loads and runs in-game.

---

## 5. Open questions

- Decoration detection: family/position-aware, not type-based.
- Output-port pinning — **DECIDED (2026-06-09), refined (2026-06-10):**
  pinning is per-sink and optional, a four-level hierarchy where each level
  is a relaxation of the one before it:
  - **Locked** (was `Pinned`): exactly this port. No optimizer freedom.
  - **Group** *(new)*: any port within this **group** — a group being the
    platform's natural cluster of co-located, same-face ports (e.g. on
    `Foundation_2x4` each face's ports split into 4-port groups by x/y
    contiguity; derivable from `platforms.json`'s flat `ports` list, not yet
    a stored field). The optimizer picks the slot within the group.
  - **Region**: any port in any group within a *named set of groups* (e.g.
    `western_faces` = the 2 west-face groups + the 2 west-most north-face
    groups). The optimizer picks both group and slot.
  - **Free**: any port on the platform, subject to **face purity** (one
    result kind per face). `Free` ≡ `Region(all groups)`.

  The level is part of each spec's semantics — e.g. the Half Splitter uses
  `Region` (west halves → `western_faces`, east → `eastern_faces`; the side
  matters), not `Free`. **`Group` is the new addressable unit**: it is what
  makes a "force this group of inputs to cross to that group of outputs"
  spec — and the crossing-budget check below — expressible at all.
  `Free`/`Region` sinks are reordered by `place()`'s monotone sink
  assignment, which always drives inversions to 0 and so cannot represent a
  forced crossing.

  The assignment stage (WP-L/WP-M) chooses slots (and groups, for `Region`)
  within whatever freedom the level leaves.

  **Encoding — `Locked`/`Group`/`Region` landed (2026-06-10):** a
  `platform_in`/`platform_out` node carries
  `{"pin": "locked"|"group"|"region", "target": ...}`. `target` is `(x, y)`
  for `locked` (an exact port position), `(face, group_index)` for `group`
  (any slot within that group, assigned in node order), or
  `[(face, group_index), ...]` for `region` (any slot within the flattened
  pool of every listed group, assigned in node order — a thin wrapper over
  `group`). Nodes without a `"pin"` key are `Free` (existing monotone
  behaviour, unchanged). `place._assign_pinned_ports` handles all three;
  `place._port_groups(plat, face)` derives groups as consecutive runs of 4
  ports from `platforms.json`'s flat `ports` list (one group per platform
  unit-edge — verified 4/4/4/4 on `Foundation_2x4`'s south face, 1 group of 4
  on every `Foundation_1x1` face). `place.group_inversions(pairs)` counts
  inversions in a source-group → sink-group permutation (the §2a worked
  example: full reversal of 4 groups = 6 inversions). Region *names* (e.g.
  `western_faces`) are not stored anywhere — callers pass the literal
  group-id list. The `Free`-sink kind→face assignment and the `Region`-sink
  group+slot output assignment (WP-L) remain open.
- Routing objective: fit-first, then compactness; how to measure vs human.
- Icon convention mismatch (`icon:Platforms` used for both quarter and full belt);
  `BinaryVersion` meaning.

---

## 6. Dependencies / build-vs-buy

Guiding principle: **buy the generic search, build the domain.** You cannot buy
Shapez-2 shape/format/belt knowledge; you should not hand-roll a constraint solver.

- **Codec** (gzip/base64/json): stdlib. Built.
- **Netlist graph + isomorphism**: `networkx` (traversal, topo-sort, and
  `is_isomorphic` with a node-type matcher for the round-trip invariants I4/I5).
  Needed from **WP-A**.
- **Shape model + simulator**: in-house (domain-specific to Shapez 2). Survey
  existing community tooling first for a reference implementation (web search was
  rate-limited; revisit).
- **Blueprint lowering / belt turn-typing**: in-house (format-specific).
- **Placement search**: a constraint solver (`OR-Tools` CP-SAT, or SAT/SMT) —
  do not hand-roll. Needed only at Rung 3.
- **Routing (multi-net, 3-D)**: mostly in-house; no clean Python package. A* core
  can lean on `networkx`; CP-SAT may absorb small instances.
- **CLI**: `argparse` (stdlib) now; `typer`/`click` optional later.

### Library survey for the scaling arc (2026-06-09)

Searched for an embeddable negotiated-congestion / grid router. Conclusion:
**build the PathFinder loop in-house** (~400 lines on `heapq` + the existing
grid model). Every existing implementation is format-locked or unembeddable,
and our cell semantics (junction variant set, directional belts, lifts, hops)
are the domain anyway:

- **VPR / VTR** (C++): the canonical PathFinder implementation. Not
  embeddable from Python; **read it for the cost schedule** if WP-I's
  parameters need retuning.
- **OrthoRoute** (Python + CUDA, KiCad plugin): PathFinder on a Manhattan
  lattice — the closest existing code to WP-I. KiCad-locked, GPU-dependent.
  Reading material, not a dependency.
- **Freerouting** (Java, Specctra DSN) / **KiCadRoutingTools** (Rust+Python,
  KiCad): PCB-format-locked rip-up-and-reroute routers. Not usable.
- **Factorio-SAT** (R-O-C-K-E-T/Factorio-SAT): SAT-encodes belt semantics to
  synthesize balancers inside small fixed boxes. Corroborates the chicken-egg
  decision (exact global models only work at window scale). Borrowable
  *pattern*, held in reserve: exact CP-SAT **local repair** of one stubborn
  congested window after PathFinder converges everywhere else. Not a WP.
- **networkx `steiner_tree`** (kou/mehlhorn): optional better initial tree
  topology for wide nets. Farthest-first growth should suffice; do not add
  until measured.
- **scipy `linear_sum_assignment`** or CP-SAT: only for WP-L's deferred
  general case; the monotone fast path needs no solver.

**Phasing:** Rungs 1–2 need at most `networkx`; `OR-Tools` arrives only at Rung 3.
The dependency footprint stays near-zero until the solver phase.

**Structural validation** (Rung 3 graph-isomorphism) defers the shape simulator
to Rung 4.

**The corpus de-risks every buy:** validate CP-SAT placement and the router
against human-optimal layouts before trusting them on novel specs.

---

## 7. Execution plan (test-first)

The concrete, TDD-ordered work plan. It supersedes §0's prose "next steps" and
details §3's ladder. **Methodology: write the test first, watch it fail, make it
pass, refactor.** A red bar that cannot pass yet is captured as
`@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True, reason=...)` (the cutter precedent) so `just
test` stays green, the gap is visible in the run output, and the marker removes
itself the moment the feature lands (strict ⇒ an unexpected pass fails the suite).

### 7.0 Test taxonomy

Six flavours; each work package below says which it adds.

1. **Calibration (unit).** Pure functions — `_machine_footprint`,
   `routing_inout`, pipe directions, shape ops. Exact, fast, no fixtures.
2. **Structural lift.** On a *closed* oracle fixture (a port on every lane):
   `unmatched_legs == 0` plus node/edge counts and per-type degree. "Topology is
   right."
3. **Functional sim.** `interpret(...)` yields the expected shapes — lane-wise on
   a corpus fixture, or exact on a hand-built minimal netlist.
4. **Round-trip / isomorphism.** The inverse-pair invariants (§7.1): routing and
   synthesis are checked by lifting their output back and comparing graphs.
5. **Physical validity.** `validate(bp)` passes for the corpus and fails — with a
   specific reason — on hand-built broken inputs (overlap, dangling, off-grid).
6. **Corpus sweep (regression).** One parametrized test over every closed
   fixture, asserting flavours 2 and 5. The blanket safety net.

### 7.1 Master invariants

Everything reduces to these; each WP moves one closer to green.

- **I1 — well-formed lift:** a closed corpus blueprint ⇒ `unmatched_legs == 0`.
- **I2 — correct lift:** recovered nodes / edges / degrees == the known structure.
- **I3 — correct sim:** `interpret(lift(bp), inputs) == expected_outputs`.
- **I4 — route is lift's inverse (Rung 3):** `isomorphic(lift(route(N, P)), N)`
  for a netlist `N` placed at fixed positions `P`.
- **I5 — synthesis is correct (Rung 4):** `isomorphic(lift(synth(spec)),
  netlist(spec))` **and** `interpret(lift(synth(spec)), in) == spec(in)`.
- **I6 — physical validity:** `validate(bp)` ⇔ `bp` is placeable and legal.
- **I7 — compactness (soft):** `belts(synth(spec)) ≤ k · belts(oracle)` — measured
  and tracked against the human oracle, not a hard gate.

Lifting is the trusted core (I1–I3, green for rotators/half-destroyer/cutter/
swapper). I4 and I5 *bootstrap off it*: we never hand-verify routed/synthesized
geometry — we lift it back and compare to the intended netlist. Route and synth
must therefore emit exactly the belt/junction types+rotations that
`lift.routing_inout` decodes; the calibration table is the single source of truth
shared by both directions, which is what makes the round-trip exact.

### 7.2 Work packages

Ordered along the **critical path to the north star**. The diagonal extractor (the
headline demo) uses only rotators, swappers, and belts — all already lifted and
simulated — so the path is IR → router → placement → synth, needing **no**
stacker/painter work. Machine-table breadth (WP-F/G/H) is a parallel track that
widens the spec space but blocks nothing on the diagonal extractor.

#### WP-A — Netlist isomorphism *(validation backbone; critical path)*
- **Goal:** a placement-independent equality on lifted netlists — the substrate
  for I4/I5. Lets us assert "this routed/synthesized blueprint realizes that
  netlist" without comparing coordinates.
- **Tests first** (`tests/test_netlist.py`, flavour 4 — scaffolded as xfail now):
  - `test_self_isomorphic` — `isomorphic(trace_layer(Q,0), trace_layer(Q,0))`.
  - `test_floors_are_isomorphic` — `isomorphic(trace_layer(Q,0),
    trace_layer(Q,1))` True: identical structure, different layer/coords ⇒ proves
    coordinate-independence on a *real* example.
  - `test_cw_ccw_180_quarters_not_isomorphic` — pairwise False: identical topology
    (4→8→4) but different rotator **type** ⇒ proves type-sensitivity.
  - `test_cutter_not_isomorphic_to_rotator`, `test_full_belt_not_isomorphic_to_
    quarter` — False (different op/degree; different size).
- **Implementation:** `lift.to_graph(nl) -> nx.MultiDiGraph` (node attr =
  `(kind, type)`, edges from `nl.edges`); `lift.isomorphic(a, b)` via
  `nx.is_isomorphic(..., node_match=by (kind, type))`. Add the `networkx` dep.
  *Port-aware* isomorphism (distinguishing a swapper's two inputs) is **deferred** —
  Rung-3 structural validity does not need it (§3).
- **Done when:** the five tests are green; `networkx` added; xfail removed.

#### WP-B — Physical validator + corpus sweep *(safety net; critical path)*
- **Goal:** I6, plus a blanket regression that makes every later change cheap to
  trust.
- **Tests first:**
  - `tests/test_validate.py` (flavour 5): `test_corpus_is_valid` parametrized over
    closed fixtures ⇒ `validate(bp) == []`; `test_overlap_detected`,
    `test_dangling_leg_detected`, `test_offgrid_detected` on hand-built broken
    blueprints ⇒ a non-empty problem list naming the cause.
  - `tests/test_corpus.py` (flavour 6): `test_closed_fixtures_lift_clean`
    parametrized over the closed registry ⇒ `unmatched_legs == 0` on every floor.
- **Implementation:** `validate(bp) -> list[Problem]` (empty ⇒ valid): (a) no two
  entities share `(x, y, L)`; (b) `unmatched_legs == 0` across floors (reuse
  lift); (c) every cell inside the platform interior (use `platforms.json` + the
  seam model). A `CLOSED_FIXTURES` / `OPEN_FIXTURES` registry in `conftest.py`
  (closed = ported, assert 0 unmatched; open = the pinwheel exports, dangling by
  design).
- **Done when:** the sweep is green over closed fixtures; broken inputs rejected
  with the right reason.

#### WP-C — Rung 3: re-route at fixed placement *(the router core; critical path)*
- **Goal:** I4. Given a netlist + the machines' existing cells, regenerate belts
  realizing every edge; lifting the result reproduces the netlist.
- **Status: SUPERSEDED BY WP-I** (this section is the historical record; the
  fan machinery described below is deleted). At hand-off: round-trip verified
  on 7 single-cell fixtures; the 2 multi-cell fixtures xfailed on tight 2D
  fan packing — resolved by WP-I's negotiated congestion.
- **Tests** (`tests/test_route.py`; flavours 4 + 5):
  1. ✓ `test_route_straight` — one src → one dst in a line ⇒ Forward belts.
  2. ✓ `test_route_one_turn` — offset on both axes ⇒ Forward + Left turn.
  3. ✓ `test_route_fanout` / `test_route_fanin` — 1→2 / 2→1 with junctions.
  4. ✓ `test_route_avoids_obstacle` — A* detours around blocked cell.
  5. ✓ `test_fanin_same_direction_merger_near_sources` — merger placed near
     machine cluster, not near sink.
  6. ✓ `test_fanout_same_direction_splitter_near_sinks` — splitter placed near
     machine cluster, not near source.
  7. ✓ `test_fanin_merger_placement_allows_distinct_directions` — merger has
     inputs from distinct directions (position assertion).
  8. ✓ `test_reroute_with_junctions_rotator_quarter` — full strip→reroute→lift
     round-trip on the rotator quarter.
  9. ✓ `test_reroute_roundtrip` — parametrized over 7 single-cell fixtures.
  10. ✓ `TestMultiCellRouting::test_cutter_outputs_route_as_distinct_ports` — a
      cutter's two outputs route as distinct ports (no bogus splitter).
  11. ✓ `TestMultiCellRouting::test_reroute_fanin_four_way` /
      `test_reroute_fanout_four_way` — ≥4-way fans on *spacious* synthetic
      layouts ⇒ all edges recovered (chained junctions).
  12. ✓ `test_reroute_roundtrip_multi_cell` — parametrized over 2 multi-cell
      fixtures (cutter_12_to_24, swap_diagonal). **Was xfail (tight 2D
      packing); flipped by WP-I.**
- **Implementation:**
  - `reroute_with_junctions(stripped, netlist)` — the main entry point. Strips
    belts, analyzes fan patterns at **cell granularity** off `netlist.port_edges`
    (each multi-cell port routed independently via `_node_cell_ports`), routes
    via sequential A* with obstacle marking.
  - **Junction placement near machine clusters (≤3-way):** when all sources
    (fan-in) or destinations (fan-out) face the same direction, the junction is
    placed next to the cluster — one endpoint feeds straight in, others turn
    perpendicular. 2-way picks the endpoint closest to the far side on the
    perpendicular axis; 3-way the median (so branches spread for `Splitter1To3` /
    `Merger3To1`).
  - **≥4-way chains:** a junction cell holds ≤3 legs, so wide fans chain.
    `_route_split_chain` is a deterministic splitter comb (dsts spread along the
    flow axis, one trunk cell each); `_route_merge_chain` is a collision-free
    merger staircase (perpendicular-spread sources folded nearest-trunk-first so
    a farther source's drop only crosses already-vacated rows). Both build
    explicit bounded paths (`_explicit_path` / `_path_belts`) — no A* wandering,
    no unbounded loops.
  - Sequential A* with obstacle marking prevents crossings by construction.
  - Emits exactly the types+rotations `lift.routing_inout` decodes — shared table,
    round-trip exact by construction.
- **Remaining gap (tight 2D fan packing):** the multi-cell *port* problem is
  solved, but the corpus packs mergers in 2D where a linear chain has no room —
  a sink can sit ~2 cells from its four sources. The merge staircase bails when
  it won't fit (unmatched legs, no crash); greedy A* congests. Closing this is
  not a standalone router fix — it needs the **placer to reserve routing room**,
  so it folds into WP-D (space-aware place-and-route). Cutter lifts back to
  ~38/66 edges; the misses are the tight 4-way fans.
- **Defer:** throughput-aware **parallel-lane** routing — one belt per edge for now.

#### WP-D — Placement (CP-SAT) *(Rung 3→4; critical path)*
- **Goal:** choose machine cells + rotations for a netlist on a platform, instead
  of reusing the oracle's placement. **Now also absorbs the last WP-C gap**: the
  router can't realize the corpus's *tight* fan-ins on the oracle's own packing
  (no room for a merger chain), so the placer must reserve routing room — port
  adjacency feasibility must account for the junction cells a fan needs, not just
  the machines. **Note:** machine placement is often a human design decision — the
  user places machines; the tool routes belts. The placer validates the full
  pipeline and will become smarter as the router matures.
- **Status: DONE (rotator quarter 16/16, swapper 8/8).** CP-SAT placer in
  `place.py`. `abstract_netlist` strips coordinates; `place()` assigns
  `(x, y, r)` via OR-Tools. Constraints: no overlap, interior bounds, rotation
  facing toward connected nodes (element constraint on direction dot-product),
  fan-out groups at same y / adjacent x / ordered by source x, sink ports
  ordered to match source flow, **2-cell port-row margin**, **2-cell inter-group
  x-gap**, **y-stagger** (edge groups placed one row closer to sources than inner
  neighbours). **Multi-cell machines** (swapper, cutter): second-cell position
  via `add_element` on rotation-indexed offset tables; both cells in
  AllDifferent + bounds; second-cell wire length in objective (keeps both cells
  near connected ports); proximity-based port assignment in `_build_netlist`
  (`_assign_ports`); BFS-based sink ordering (`_trace_all_sinks`) handles
  multi-input machines. Routes **16/16** rotator and **8/8** swapper edges.
  **Key insight:** the y-component of wire length is invariant: for every edge,
  `|src_y - machine_y| + |machine_y - sink_y| = const` regardless of machine y.
  The solver was indifferent among y-assignments and happened to find the flat
  layout first. Edge groups' horizontal trunks (from off-column sources) collide
  with inner groups' vertical trunks at the shared y-level. The oracle staggers
  groups across two y-levels so trunks use different y-levels and don't cross.
  The y-stagger constraint (`group_ys[0] > group_ys[1]`, `group_ys[-1] >
  group_ys[-2]`) deterministically produces this pattern.
  Router-side fixes also landed: `route_astar` `start == end` obstacle check,
  conditional outside-in fan-out ordering via `_perp_reach`, fan-in retry logic
  (`_route_fanin_pass` tries default and distance-sorted orderings).
- **Tests:**
  - ✓ `test_place_single_rotator` — feasible placement, no overlap, interior.
  - ✓ `test_place_two_rotators_no_overlap` — AllDifferent stress.
  - ✓ `test_place_then_route_rotator_quarter` — 16/16 edges, isomorphic.
  - ✓ `test_swapper_placement_solves` — CP-SAT places 2 swappers.
  - ✓ `test_swapper_second_cells_no_overlap` — all footprint cells distinct.
  - ✓ `test_swapper_lowered_validates` — lowered blueprint passes validation.
  - ✓ `test_swapper_lowered_interprets` — diagonal shapes verified.
  - TODO: `test_placement_compact` (bounding box / belt count within `k×` oracle).
- **Implementation:** OR-Tools CP-SAT — vars = `(cell, rotation)` per machine
  + `(second_x, second_y)` per multi-cell machine (element constraints on R);
  constraints = AllDifferent over all cells (anchor + second), on-grid, rotation
  facing, fan-group structure, source/sink ordering, port-row margin 2,
  inter-group gap 2, y-stagger; objective = minimize total Manhattan wire length
  including second-cell distances.
- **Done when:** place+route reproduces the quarter and full belt structurally;
  compactness tracked.

#### WP-E — Rung 4: synthesize from spec *(the product; critical path)*
- **Goal:** I5. Spec → netlist → place (D) → route (C) → entities → file.
- **Status: DONE for single-op, series-chain, and diagonal-trick platforms.**
  `Spec(op, platform, throughput)` for uniform lane pipelines; `DiagonalSpec(pairs,
  platform)` for the diagonal trick. `_lower(abstract, platform)` runs the generic
  pipeline on any abstract netlist. 26 tests green, 1 xfail (series+throughput=2
  on 1×1 — 16 machines too dense). CLI: `synth rotate_cw,rotate_cw --throughput 1`
  or `synth swap_diagonal [--pairs N]`.
- **Tests:**
  - ✓ `test_rotate_180_quarter_topology` — 4 src + 8 machines + 4 sinks, 16 edges.
  - ✓ `test_machine_type_matches_op` — CW spec → RotatorOneQuad machines.
  - ✓ `test_edge_structure_fan_out_fan_in` — each src fans to T, each sink gathers T.
  - ✓ `test_series_chain_topology` — 4×1×2 stages = 8 machines, 12 edges.
  - ✓ `test_series_chain_edge_structure` — every machine 1-in/1-out.
  - ✓ `test_series_with_throughput_topology` — 4×2×2 = 16 machines, 24 edges.
  - ✓ `test_synth_rotate_180_quarter` — isomorphic to oracle.
  - ✓ `test_synth_rotate_180_quarter_validate` — physical validation clean.
  - ✓ `test_synth_rotate_180_quarter_interpret` — RuCuSuWu → SuWuRuCu on all lanes.
  - ✓ `test_synth_rotate_cw_quarter` — isomorphic to oracle.
  - ✓ `test_synth_rotate_ccw_quarter` — isomorphic to oracle.
  - ✓ `test_synth_half_destroy_quarter` — validates + interprets → RuCu---- on all.
  - ✓ `test_series_cw_cw_equals_180` — 2×CW in series = 180° (validate + interpret).
  - ✓ `test_series_ccw_ccw_ccw_equals_cw` — 3×CCW = CW (validate + interpret).
  - ✗ `test_series_with_throughput` — xfail (16 machines on 1×1 too dense).
  - ✓ `test_swapper_placement_solves` — 2 swappers placed by CP-SAT.
  - ✓ `test_swapper_second_cells_no_overlap` — all footprint cells distinct.
  - ✓ `test_swapper_lowered_validates` — lowered swapper blueprint clean.
  - ✓ `test_swapper_lowered_interprets` — diagonal shapes from north/south inputs.
  - ✓ `TestDiagonalNetlist::test_two_pair_topology` — 4 src, 2 swap, 4 sink, 8 edges.
  - ✓ `TestDiagonalNetlist::test_machine_type_is_swapper` — correct entity type.
  - ✓ `TestDiagonalNetlist::test_each_swapper_has_two_in_two_out` — 2-in/2-out.
  - ✓ `TestDiagonalNetlist::test_sources_interleaved_north_south` — port ordering.
  - ✓ `TestDiagonalNetlist::test_too_many_pairs_raises` — validation.
  - ✓ `TestDiagonalSynthesize::test_diagonal_validates` — physical validation clean.
  - ✓ `TestDiagonalSynthesize::test_diagonal_edge_count` — 8/8 edges realized.
  - ✓ `TestDiagonalSynthesize::test_diagonal_interprets` — diagonals from N/S inputs.
- **Remaining:** scaling to 4 pairs (the full-belt target) — Foundation_2x2
  port calibration done (Q5 resolved); placer needs multi-edge port support.

#### WP-F — Stacker cross-floor lift *(breadth track)*
- **Goal:** lift inter-floor machines; complete the table for stacking specs.
- **Status: cross-floor lift DONE.** `_machine_footprint` returns 3-D offsets
  `(dx, dy, dl)` for all machines; the stacker claims `(0, 0, 1)` as a
  secondary input (in from back, no output). Three output variants:
  `StackerStraight` (forward), `StackerDefault` (right of flow),
  `StackerDefaultMirrored` (left of flow). `_occupancy_3d` + `trace(bp)` span
  all floors; `trace_layer` unchanged for single-floor families. All 10 callers
  of `_machine_footprint` updated to filter `dl == 0` where needed. All prior
  tests still pass (161 + 3 xfail).
- **Tests:**
  - ✓ `test_footprint_vertical_input` — all 3 stacker variants at R=0.
  - ✓ `test_footprint_rotated` — cross-floor input direction rotates with R.
  - ✓ `test_stacker_nodes_in_single_layer_trace` — 4 stackers found by
    `trace_layer` (open fixture, no edges — no ports).
  - ✓ `test_stacker_cross_floor_trace_synthetic` — programmatic closed fixture
    with ports on L0+L1: stacker is 2-in (L0 primary + L1 secondary) / 1-out.
  - ✓ `test_stacker_cross_floor_trace_finds_all_nodes` — both open fixtures
    (4 straight, 8 bent) produce the right node counts.
- **Shape op DONE.** `Shape` extended to multi-layer (`upper` field, `:` syntax).
  `shapes.stack(bottom, top)` implements full gravity (gap layer, orthogonal
  adjacency grouping, group falling, MAX_LAYERS truncation). `_machine_op` wired
  for `Stacker → stack`. 16 new tests (multi-layer parse/rotate, stacking with
  overlap/no-overlap/diagonal-gravity/truncation, gravity group adjacency).
  Remaining: the **interpreter** can't exercise stackers on real blueprints until
  it supports 3-D node keys (cross-floor `port_edges`).

#### WP-G — Painter pipe layer *(breadth track)*
- **Goal:** lift fluid machines (painter, later crystallizer/miner).
- **Tests first:** `test_pipe_directions` (unit: pipe Forward/turn/junction in/out
  sides per R, calibrated like belts); `test_painter_lifts_clean` (a clean
  belted+piped painter lifts at 0 unmatched across **both** layers; the painter
  node has shape-in + paint-in + shape-out).
- **Implementation:** a `pipe_inout` table mirroring `routing_inout`; a two-graph
  occupancy (belts carry shapes, pipes carry fluid); the painter consumes from
  both. Likely needs a fresh export with belts **and** pipes on its I/O —
  `QUESTIONS.md` Q4b. Sim needs a color model (defer).

#### WP-H — Full-blueprint functional drive *(breadth track; confidence, not capability)* — **DONE**
- **Goal:** I3 on a whole dense blueprint, not just hand-built netlists.
- **Solution:** `interpret(nl, inputs, collect=True)` allows throughput-merged
  sinks to return `frozenset[Shape]` instead of raising. `classify_sources(nl)`
  partitions sources into swapper feed groups via 2-coloring.
- **Verified on `swap_diagonal`:** 26 sources, 26 sinks, 32 swappers, 48
  rotators. With uniform input S: 17 single-feed sinks → `{S}`, 9 multi-feed
  sinks → `{S, CW(S)}`. Source partition: 9 group A + 8 group B + 9 pass-through.
- **Tests:** `TestFullBlueprintDrive` — `test_swap_diagonal_computes_diagonals`,
  `test_swap_diagonal_sink_counts`, `test_classify_sources_partitions`.

#### WP-I — PathFinder detailed router *(critical path; replaces sequential A\*)* — **DONE**

Read §2a first. This WP needs **no new calibration** and **no new fixtures** —
start here.

- **Goal:** replace hard-obstacle sequential A\* with negotiated-congestion
  routing. Acceptance gate: the two corpus xfails
  (`test_reroute_roundtrip_multi_cell` over `cutter_12_to_24` and
  `swap_diagonal`) go green **on the oracle's own placement** — strip belts,
  re-route, lift back, isomorphic (I4).
- **New module** `src/shapez2_tools/pathfinder.py`. Keep `route.py` working
  until parity, then make `reroute_with_junctions` delegate to it (callers and
  tests keep the same entry point).
- **Data model** (single floor for now; the `layer` slot exists so WP-J does
  not change signatures):

  ```python
  Cell = tuple[int, int, int]              # (x, y, layer); layer == 0 until WP-J

  @dataclass
  class Net:
      net_id: int
      kind: Literal["fanout", "fanin"]     # 1→N or N→1; a 1→1 net is fanout, N=1
      root: Cell                           # the single-port end
      terminals: list[Cell]                # the N-port end
      tree_cells: set[Cell]                # result of growth
      tree_edges: list[tuple[Cell, Cell]]  # directed src→dst, derived after growth

  class RoutingGraph:
      passable: set[Cell]                  # interior minus machine cells
      base: dict[Cell, float]              # 1.0 everywhere initially
      hist: dict[Cell, float]              # accumulated overuse history, starts 0.0
      occ: dict[Cell, set[int]]            # net ids currently claiming the cell
  ```

- **Net extraction:** from `netlist.port_edges` at **cell granularity** (reuse
  `_node_cell_ports` from `route.py`). Group edges into connected components by
  shared endpoint cells. Each component must be 1→N (one source cell) or N→1
  (one sink cell); `raise NotImplementedError` on N→M components (none exist
  in current specs; do not silently mishandle one). Copy the endpoint
  conventions from `reroute_with_junctions` verbatim — including the
  adjacent-skip fix (when an endpoint is adjacent to the junction, there is no
  trunk to route).
- **Signal router (route one net):** grow a tree from `root`. Connect
  terminals **farthest-first** (builds the trunk first, the way the oracle's
  combs do). Each connection is one Dijkstra run seeded with *every current
  tree cell at cost 0*, expanding only through `passable` cells, terminating
  at the terminal. Rules:
  - Tree cells are seeds, never intermediate path cells (prevents within-net
    cycles): once seeded, do not re-expand into a tree cell.
  - Expansion *out of* a tree cell `t` is allowed only while `legs(t) < 4` and
    the resulting leg pattern stays in the legal set (§2a). Track per-cell leg
    counts on the growing tree.
  - For `fanin` nets, grow the identical tree with root = the sink cell and
    terminals = the sources, then flip every edge direction when deriving
    `tree_edges`.
- **Cost function** (the negotiation — this is the entire trick):

  ```
  overuse(n)    = max(0, len(occ[n] − {this_net}) + 1 − 1)     # capacity = 1
  enter_cost(n) = (base[n] + hist[n]) * (1 + pres_fac * overuse(n))
  ```

- **Global loop:**

  ```
  pres_fac = PRES_FAC_INIT
  for iteration in range(MAX_ITERS):
      for net in nets sorted by net_id:          # rip up and reroute EVERY net
          release net's cells from occ
          regrow net's tree under current costs
          claim the new cells in occ
      if no cell has len(occ) > 1:  SUCCESS
      for every overused cell n:    hist[n] += HIST_GAIN * (len(occ[n]) − 1)
      pres_fac *= PRES_FAC_MULT
  FAIL → return the overused cells               # placement feedback for WP-M
  ```

  Early iterations: `pres_fac` is small, every net takes its best path,
  overlaps allowed. Later: shared cells get expensive; nets with alternatives
  move off; nets without alternatives stay and pay. The history term breaks
  oscillation (two nets endlessly swapping the same two corridors).
- **Parameters** (record any retuning here; do not scatter magic numbers):
  `BASE = 1.0`, `PRES_FAC_INIT = 0.5`, `PRES_FAC_MULT = 1.8`,
  `HIST_GAIN = 1.0`, `MAX_ITERS = 60`.
- **Emit:** per tree cell, legs = incident `tree_edges` with directions ⇒
  `(in_sides, out_sides)` ⇒ entity type + R via the **inverse of
  `lift.routing_inout`**. Build the inverse table once, programmatically, in a
  helper (`emit_table()`); **never hand-write a second table** — the I4
  round-trip depends on the two directions sharing one source of truth.
- **Determinism:** sort nets by `net_id`; Dijkstra tie-break by
  `(cost, y, x, layer)`. Tests assert run-twice-identical output.
- **Tests first** (`tests/test_pathfinder.py`, flavours 4 + 5):
  1. `test_blocked_pocket_negotiates` — net B's sink sits in a pocket with a
     single entrance cell; net A's shortest path runs through that entrance
     but A has a detour. Route A first. Sequential hard-obstacle routing
     strands B; assert PathFinder routes both, disjoint cells.
  2. `test_oscillation_breaks_via_history` — two nets, two equal-cost shared
     corridors (symmetric — the classic oscillation case); assert convergence
     in < `MAX_ITERS` and both routed.
  3. `test_tight_fanin_two_cells_from_sink` — 4 sources, sink ~2 cells away
     (the corpus disease the merger staircase bails on, synthesized small);
     assert all 4 edges route and lift back.
  4. `test_fanout_tree_legs_legal` / `test_fanin_tree_legs_legal` — 1→4 and
     4→1 in open space; every tree cell's leg pattern is in the legal set;
     emitted junctions decode via `routing_inout`.
  5. `test_emit_roundtrip_small` — tiny netlist → route → emit → lift →
     `isomorphic`.
  6. `test_single_cell_corpus_parity` — parametrize the 7 single-cell fixtures
     through the new router (strip → pathfinder → lift ≅ original).
  7. `test_deterministic` — route the same instance twice; identical entity
     lists.
  8. **The gate:** remove xfail from `test_reroute_roundtrip_multi_cell`
     (cutter_12_to_24: 66/66 edges; swap_diagonal: all edges).
- **Done when:** the gate is green, single-cell parity holds, the corpus sweep
  is green, and `_route_split_chain` / `_route_merge_chain` are deleted (the
  tree growth subsumes both).
- **Pitfalls:**
  - There is no 2-in/2-out cell. If two nets *topologically must* cross on one
    floor, PathFinder will iterate to `MAX_ITERS` and fail — that is correct
    behaviour; crossing capacity arrives in WP-J/WP-K. Do not "fix" it here.
  - A junction cell belongs to exactly one net. Cell capacity is always 1.
  - Machine cells are not passable; platform border cells are not passable;
    port cells are endpoints with fixed directions.
  - Throughput-aware parallel lanes stay deferred (one belt per edge).

#### WP-J — third dimension: floors + lifts *(crossing capacity, part 1)* — DONE

- **Goal:** routes change floors through lift entities; the router decides
  when going up-and-over beats detouring.
- **Calibration (Q8) bypassed** — same approach as WP-K: mined empirical
  data from the 12-to-12 Balancer (`data/reference/balancer_12_to_12.spz2bp`,
  46 lifts, 3 floors). No user fixture needed.
- **lift.py:** `lift_inout(type, r)` → `(ins, outs, delta)` for all 16 lift
  variants. `_lift_footprint(type, r)` → multi-floor cell expansion. Input
  always from back at entity's own layer; output at L±delta in the named exit
  direction. `_Cell.out_layer_delta` enables cross-floor output in 3-D trace.
  `_occupancy` and `_occupancy_3d` handle lift multi-floor cells (input cell
  at entity floor, output cell at target floor, blockers between).
- **pathfinder.py:** `RoutingGraph(lift_enabled=True)` enables vertical
  neighbor expansion in `_grow_tree`. `LIFT_COST = 3.0`. `_lift_emit_table()`
  inverts `lift_inout` to map `(ins, outs, delta)` → `(variant, r)`.
  `_cell_to_entity` emits lift entities at cross-floor edge sources.
- **Tests (30 new in `tests/test_lift_3d.py`):** `TestLiftInout` (12
  parametrized R=0 variants + rotation + non-lift → None + all-16 sweep),
  `TestLiftFootprint` (Lift1 2-cell, Lift2 3-cell, input/output split),
  `TestBalancer` (0 unmatched legs all floors, 3-D trace ports, edges,
  all 3 floors used), `TestLiftEmitTable` (all 16 in table, roundtrip),
  `TestCrossingNets` (fails without lift, succeeds with, uses lift edges,
  emits valid lift entities).

#### WP-K — launcher/catcher hops *(crossing capacity, part 2)*

- **Goal:** same-floor crossings via flight. Entities identified:
  `BeltPortSenderVariant` (launcher) / `BeltPortReceiverVariant` (catcher) —
  the placeable siblings of the platform-edge port slots (`*InternalVariant`).
- **Tracer side: DONE.** `_platform_port_positions(bp)` loads known edge-port
  positions from `platforms.json`. `_is_interior_hop(type, pos, ports)` tests
  whether a port entity is at a non-edge position. `_resolve_hops(bp, layer,
  ports)` pairs interior senders with receivers: scan along the sender's
  facing direction, first receiver with the same rotation wins. Verified on
  the Half Splitter (145/145 pairs, 0 unresolved) and the swap_diagonal
  corpus fixture (18 pairs). `trace_layer(..., contract_hops=True)` marks hop
  endpoints as belt cells and jumps from sender to receiver in `down()`, so
  the belt contraction threads through hops transparently. Default is
  `contract_hops=False` (backward-compatible — existing corpus tests
  unaffected). 5 new tests in `tests/test_lift.py` (209 total, 1 xfail).
- **Router side: DONE.** `RoutingGraph(hop_range=N)` enables hop expansion in
  Dijkstra: from every cell × 4 directions × distances 2..N. Hop cost =
  `distance * BASE + HOP_PENALTY` (strictly more expensive than walking; only
  congestion tips the balance). Hop endpoint cells occupy normally; flight
  cells are free. `_cell_to_entity` emits `BeltPortSenderInternalVariant` /
  `BeltPortReceiverInternalVariant` at hop endpoints with rotation matching
  the flight direction. `strip_and_reroute(..., hop_range=N)` passes the
  parameter through. `Net.hop_edges` tracks non-adjacent tree edges for
  emission. Hop cells are excluded from further seed growth (no splitter/hop
  hybrid entities). 3 new tests in `tests/test_pathfinder.py`.
- **Lift side first, router second** (I4 requires the tracer to understand
  hops before the router may emit them):
  1. ~~Q7 fixture~~ — **bypassed**: mined pairing rules empirically from the
     Half Splitter (145 interior hop pairs). Remaining sub-questions (hard
     limits) are edge cases for the router, not the tracer.
  2. ✓ Tracer: resolve sender→receiver pairing by scanning along the sender's
     facing direction; the pair becomes a transparent belt connection.
  3. ✓ Router: hop edges in Dijkstra with congestion-gated cost. Endpoint
     cells occupy normally; flight cells free. Sender/receiver entities
     emitted with correct rotation. Round-trip verified via
     `contract_hops=True` re-lift.
- **Tests:**
  - ✓ `test_hop_pairing_half_splitter` — 145/145 pairs on the Half Splitter.
  - ✓ `test_hop_contraction_half_splitter` — 16 src, 64 cutters, 32 sinks.
  - ✓ `test_hop_contraction_swap_diagonal` — 8 src, 80 machines, 8 sinks.
  - ✓ `test_hop_contraction_no_hops_unchanged` — no-hop corpus = same result.
  - ✓ `test_swap_diagonal_hop_pairs` — 18 pairs resolved.
  - ✓ `test_hop_resolves_crossing` — two crossing 1→1 nets routed via hop.
  - ✓ `test_hop_emit_roundtrip` — route → emit → re-lift ≅ original.
  - ✓ `test_no_hop_when_unnecessary` — hops not used without congestion.
- **Done:** single-floor topological crossing routes via hop and round-trips.

#### WP-L — lane assignment + symmetry quotient *(shrink the instance first)* — **DONE**

Pure software, no fixtures, independent of I/J/K. Every crossing removed here
is one the router never negotiates.

- **Status: DONE.** `_monotone_sort` in `synth.py` sorts source/sink nodes
  by ascending x before placement (by `orig_x` from lifted netlists, or
  numeric ID suffix from synthesized ones). `abstract_netlist()` in `place.py`
  now carries `orig_x` on port nodes. `synthesize_quotient(spec)` synthesizes
  one floor and stamps across three floors via `generator.stamp`. 3 new tests
  (201 total, 1 xfail).
- **Monotone assignment (build first, covers all current specs):** when a
  spec's machine instances are interchangeable (synth *created* them, so it
  knows), assign the k-th leftmost input lane group to the k-th leftmost
  machine slot, and the k-th machine to the k-th output port group. Monotone
  assignment minimizes pairwise inversions for uniform specs — most "insane"
  crossings never come into existence. Implementation: a deterministic sort in
  `synth._lower` before placement; no solver.
- **Output-port assignment (scope added 2026-06-09, refined 2026-06-10):**
  for `Region` and `Free` sinks (§5 pinning decision) the assignment stage
  also chooses **which physical port each sink uses**, not just the ordering
  within pinned groups. Monotone rule extends naturally: sort each result
  kind's sinks and its candidate ports in flow order, assign k-th to k-th.
  For `Region` sinks (the Half Splitter case) the candidate set is the
  union of the region's `Group`s — nothing else to decide. Only `Free` sinks
  need the extra kind→face step: assign whole faces to one kind (face
  purity) minimizing total Manhattan distance from the kind's machine
  outputs to the face (a tiny assignment problem; brute force is fine).
  `Group`/`Locked` sinks (§5) bypass this stage entirely — their group/port
  is fixed by the spec, not chosen here; `place()` must stop reordering them
  via `_trace_all_sinks`.
- **General case (defer until a real need):** interchangeable-instance groups
  on *lifted* netlists + pairwise-crossing minimization via CP-SAT (bool
  `x[i][s]` = instance i in slot s; crossing bools reified from order
  inversions; minimize the sum). Do not build speculatively.
- **Symmetry quotient:** for lane-uniform specs, route **one** lane group on a
  one-unit-wide strip and stamp at pitch 20 — `generator.py` already stamps
  exactly this way for the rotator family; promote stamping into
  `synth._lower` as a fast path. A 48-lane spec with 4-fold uniformity is a
  12-lane routing problem.
- **Tests:**
  - ✓ `test_monotone_assignment_no_inversions` — uniform spec, 0 inversions.
  - ✓ `test_reversed_pins_minimized` — reversed source list order, monotone
    sort reorders to natural order, 0 inversions after placement.
  - ✓ `test_quotient_isomorphic_to_direct` — quotient+stamp lift ≅ direct
    route lift per floor, belt counts exactly 3×.
- **Done when:** synth uses monotone ordering and the quotient fast path, and
  the existing synth suite stays green. ✓

#### WP-M — channel-capacity placement *(replaces hand constraints; consumes router feedback)*

Build **after** WP-I (it consumes PathFinder's overuse output as feedback).

- ✅ **Row template:** `_compute_stages(abstract)` assigns each machine a BFS
  depth from sources. All machines at the same stage share a single `row_y`
  CP-SAT variable. Routing channels between rows (and between ports and the
  nearest row) have height ≥ 2 cells, enforced as `row_y[r] - row_y[r+1] >= 3`
  (1 row + 2 channel). This replaces the individual per-machine y-variables.
- **Density constraint (the heart):** per channel, per x-bucket of width 4:
  `(number of nets whose horizontal interval covers the bucket) ≤ h[c] ×
  floors_available`. A net's interval ends are reified from its endpoints'
  placement vars. Buckets stay coarse to bound model size. This is classic
  channel-routing density, and it is what "the placer reserves routing room"
  concretely means. **(Not yet implemented.)**
- ✅ **Delete the hand constraints** (y-stagger, 2-cell inter-group gap, port-row
  margin) — their effects emerge from the row model. Tests assert outcomes
  (round-trip, validation), never constraint presence.
- ✅ **Feedback loop:** `_lower()` catches `RoutingError`, adds overused cells
  to a `forbidden` set, and retries `place()` up to 3 times. `place()` accepts
  `forbidden: set[tuple[int, int]]` and excludes those cells from all machine
  flat positions.
  **(Future: map overused cells to channel/bucket for density feedback.)**
- ✅ **Hop direction constraints:** sender approach (fed from opposite the
  hop), receiver exit (continue in hop direction), terminal exit (hops to
  terminals must match boundary edge direction), no double-hop, root approach.
  `_resolve_hops` sender sort for deterministic pairing.
- ✅ **A\* heuristic:** `manhattan(cell, terminal) × BASE` as admissible
  heuristic in `_grow_tree`. Platform bounds from `platforms.json` replace
  the fixed-margin bounding box. 2×4 diagonal: 2.44s → 0.62s (3.9×).
- ✅ **North-star gate 1:** `test_synth_diagonal_full_belt_2x4` — 8-pair
  diagonal on Foundation_2x4 with hop\_range=4, 32/32 edges, validates +
  interprets to correct diagonals on all 16 lanes. **PASSES.**
- ✅ **`Group`/`Locked` sink pinning (§5):** `place._assign_pinned_ports`
  (pin = `"locked"` → exact `(x, y)`, `"group"` → `(face, group_index)`,
  next free slot in node order); `place._port_groups(plat, face)` chunks
  `platforms.json`'s `ports` list into 4-port groups; `_trace_all_sinks`
  skips already-pinned sinks so the Free monotone reorder no longer
  normalizes pinned nets to 0 inversions. `place.group_inversions(pairs)`
  counts the group-level permutation's inversions. §2a worked example (4
  groups, full reversal → 6 inversions) verified
  (`tests/test_place.py::TestPortGroups`, `TestGroupInversions`,
  `TestPinnedPorts`, 7 new tests).
- ✅ **`Region` sink pinning (§5):** `place._assign_pinned_ports` adds
  `pin = "region"` → `target = [(face, group_index), ...]`, the flattened
  slot pool of every listed group, next free slot in node order. Verified on
  the Half Splitter's own `western_faces`/`eastern_faces` regions on
  `Foundation_2x4` — 16 disjoint slots each
  (`tests/test_place.py::TestPinnedPorts`, 2 new tests, 260 total).
- **Crossing budget check (§2a):** before solving, compare the pinned
  permutation's inversion count (now computable, see above) against total
  crossing capacity (floors + hops + channel slack); reject infeasible specs
  with a counting message. **Capacity side not yet derived** — see §2a.
- ✅ **North-star gate 2:** `test_synth_half_splitter_2x4` — the Half
  Splitter (§2a: 16 in south, cut, west halves out on
  `Region(western_faces)`, east halves on `Region(eastern_faces)`) validates
  + interprets correctly: 0 unmatched legs, 48/48 lifted edges, all 32
  outputs land in their `Region` with the **correct half** — but **not** any
  specific slot assignment within a region. **PASSED at the placeholder
  topology** (WP-M2, 2026-06-11: 1 cutter/lane, illegal `hop_range=8`);
  **reopened** at the representative topology (4 cutters/lane,
  `hop_range=5`) — now `xfail(strict=True)`, see WP-N.
  Multi-face port support, `Region` pin encoding, and `CutterSpec` +
  `synthesize_cutter()` all landed (above).
  - **WP-L's region-constrained output assignment** (choosing group *and*
    slot per sink within its region — currently `_assign_pinned_ports` fills
    slots in raw node order with no flow-based ordering). **Not required for
    gate 2** (the gate asserts region membership only, not slot order).
  - Record belts vs the human oracle where one exists (I7, tracked metric,
    soft target ≤ 2×) — **not yet recorded**: the human's `UNFINISHED Half
    Splitter` is a larger, multi-floor design (64 cutters) and isn't a
    like-for-like comparison against the single-floor 16-lane gate.
- **Done when:** both north-star gates pass end-to-end (spec → assign → place
  → route → emit → lift → interpret).

#### WP-M2 — south-flow convention + Half Splitter gate *(detailed handoff spec)* — **DONE**

**Design convention (user decision, 2026-06-11): items flow south → north.**
Sources (inputs) go on the **south face (1)**, sinks (outputs) on the
**north face (3)** — always, for every synthesized design. West/east faces
are used only when one face's port count is insufficient: e.g. the full-lane
stacker (a future spec: 8 full-belt inputs, 4 outputs) takes inputs on
south+west+east and outputs on north. Encoded as `place.SOURCE_FACE = 1` /
`place.SINK_FACE = 3`; never hardcode 1/3 elsewhere.

**The gate-2 blocker was three separate problems** (diagnosed empirically
2026-06-11; each experiment is reproducible):

1. **Port capacity.** At 16 lanes the two regions consume all 32 ports on
   faces 0+2+3 (Foundation_2x4: 8 west + 8 east + 16 north), and the old
   convention (sources north) left zero source ports → bare `IndexError` in
   `place()`. **Resolved by the convention flip**: sources now default to
   the south face (16 free ports), which is also what the real Half Splitter
   does.
2. **Density-constraint misattribution.** The channel-capacity model charged
   *every* `platform_in` edge to channel 0 and every machine→sink edge to a
   row channel, bucketed by x-interval — meaningless for west/east-face or
   pinned ports whose routes run along the platform sides, not across the
   horizontal channels. Consequence: CP-SAT INFEASIBLE at ≥ 4 lanes with
   south sources; with density disabled, 16 lanes routed fine (48/48 edges,
   0 unmatched legs, 14.2 s). **Resolved in the working tree**: density now
   counts only edges whose port endpoint is a *primary-face* port
   (`primary_port_ids`), and channel heights are computed for both flow
   orientations.
3. **Half→side semantics.** With south sources the rotation constraint turns
   every cutter to face north (R=1). The half→cell mapping is **absolute and
   game-verified** (machines.md, `cutters_8_pinwheel.spz2bp`, all 4 rotations
   × both variants): *anchor cell front = east half, second cell front =
   west half*, for `Default` **and** `Mirrored`. At R=1, `Default`'s second
   cell sits **east** of the anchor (right of flow), so the west half exits
   on the east side and `_assign_ports`' proximity assignment wires the
   wrong port — measured 28/32 sinks wrong at 16 lanes. `Mirrored`'s second
   cell sits **west** at R=1 (left of flow), putting the west half on the
   west side. The human's `UNFINISHED Half Splitter` confirms variant-mixing
   is the intended mechanism (32 `Default` + 32 `Mirrored`). **Fix: the
   cutter fan must use `CutterDefaultInternalVariantMirrored`** (task 1).
   `lift._machine_footprint`, `place._is_multi_cell`, and
   `place._second_cell_tables` already handle `Mirrored`; `interpret`'s
   anchor-first output order is variant-independent and already correct.

**Already in the working tree (2026-06-11, verified — do not redo):**
`place.py` now has `SOURCE_FACE`/`SINK_FACE` constants; flipped defaults
(`all_source_ports`/`all_sink_ports`, `face` key defaults, primary
rotations, `_trace_all_sinks`); extra-face port assignment skips pinned
positions and raises a clear error when a face is full; clear capacity
errors replace the silent `IndexError` for primary-face sources/sinks;
density constraints are orientation-aware (both `input_y > output_y` and
the south-flow `else` branch) and face-aware (`primary_port_ids`). Suite
state at handoff: 262/266 pass; the 4 failures were exactly problem 3
(`tests/test_place.py::TestCutterDefault` ×2,
`tests/test_synth.py::TestCutterSynthesize` halves tests ×2). All 5 tasks
below are now done; suite state: **268/268 pass**, `just lint` clean.

**Tasks (in order):**
1. **Switch the cutter fan to the Mirrored variant.** In `synth.py`, point
   the cutter-fan netlist at `CutterDefaultInternalVariantMirrored` (rename
   the constant so it isn't a lie, e.g. `CUTTER_FAN_TYPE`). Fix the two
   `TestCutterSynthesize` halves tests by re-running them (no assertion
   changes should be needed — they assert region membership + correct half,
   which Mirrored makes true). Rewrite the two `TestCutterDefault` placer
   tests in `tests/test_place.py` to the new convention: south source,
   Mirrored cutter, west-face + north-face sinks; assert the west half
   lands on the west-face sink per the absolute mapping above.
2. **Fix `CutterSpec.validate()`.** It counts face-3 ports for sources;
   under the convention it must count `SOURCE_FACE` ports (import the
   constant). Add a region-capacity check: `lanes` must not exceed the slot
   count of either region from `side_regions(plat)`. Clear `ValueError`
   messages for both.
3. **Add north-star gate 2 as a test:** `test_synth_half_splitter_2x4` —
   `CutterSpec(lanes=16, platform="Foundation_2x4")`, `hop_range=4`. Assert:
   `validate(bp) == []`, `unmatched_legs == 0`, lifted edges == 48, all 32
   sinks in their region with the correct half (reuse the 4-lane test's
   structure). Expected runtime ~15 s — if that's too slow for the default
   suite, follow whatever slow-test convention `tests/` already has, or add
   a `slow` marker; do not silently drop the test.
4. **Sweep stale convention references.** `CutterSpec`/
   `netlist_from_cutter_spec` docstrings say "north-face sources"; §0 of
   this spec and any other "sources on the north wall" text. Grep for
   `face 3`, `north wall`, `north-face source`.
5. **Re-verify the ladder + housekeeping.** Full suite green, `just lint`,
   update §0 (status header, test counts, gate-2 line) and §7.3. Optionally
   record the I7 metric: belts in the synthesized 16-lane Half Splitter vs
   the human build.

**Hints / expected failure modes:** if halves are still wrong on a few
lanes after task 1, suspect `_assign_ports` proximity ties (the two output
cells equidistant from a sink) — inspect the tie-break, don't touch the
calibration tables. If 16 lanes won't route, raise `hop_range` before
touching PathFinder parameters. The row model degenerates gracefully for
single-stage specs (one shared `row_y` between the two port walls) — no row
work should be needed.

#### WP-N — placement for crossing-rich topologies *(detailed handoff spec; critical path)*

**Why this exists (decision 2026-06-11).** Gate 2 at the representative
topology (16 lanes × 4 cutters/lane, `hop_range=5`) is INFEASIBLE at
*placement* (§2a "Gate-2 blockers", blocker 2). Three structural problems,
all consequences of one wrong contract — the placer guarantees crossing-free
geometry via hard constraints, but the Half Splitter cannot be routed
without crossings:

1. The 2-member fan-group adjacency (`abs(m_x[a] - m_x[b]) == 1`,
   `place.py` ~line 661) — also independently buggy: at R=1 a Mirrored
   cutter's second cell sits *west* of its anchor, so two cutters at
   adjacent x must overlap. This alone is the
   `lanes=1, cutters_per_lane=2` infeasibility.
2. The cross-group total order (`place.py` ~lines 667–690) assumes each
   group routes onward in one direction; cutter-fan groups feed both
   Regions, so no linear order exists.
3. The row model: all same-stage machines share one `row_y`, but 64
   Mirrored cutters × 2 cells = 128 cells on a 76-wide `Foundation_2x4`
   interior — the cutter stage cannot be one row at 16 lanes. The human
   layout is 16 lane-*columns* × 4 cutters stacked vertically.

**New contract:** the placer produces a geometry whose **crossing demand
fits the routing capacity** (hops + lifts + channel slack); PathFinder pays
for the crossings. The crossing budget (§2a) replaces the deleted hard
constraints as the thing that keeps the placer honest.

**Key existence proof:** the human build
(`~/Projects/shapez_2_blueprints/UNFINISHED Half Splitter.spz2bp`) is a
*complete placement* of exactly this instance — 48 splitters + 64 cutters +
96 mergers, single floor, every machine locally routed. When CP-SAT says
INFEASIBLE, it is definitionally the model, not the problem. It is only a
*partial routing* proof: 15/32 outputs (exactly the maximal-crossing hauls)
were never routed, so single-floor routability of the full instance is
genuinely open — that is what task 1 measures.

**Tasks (in order):**

1. **Decisive experiment first — re-route the human placement** (rung 3 at
   true scale; do this *before* touching `place.py` — its outcome scopes
   tasks 3–4). Lift the UNFINISHED Half Splitter; keep all machine
   entities fixed; strip belts and hops (splitter/merger junctions are
   routing primitives, so stripping removes them — PathFinder re-derives
   fan trees as Steiner branching). The lifted netlist is missing the ~15
   unrouted cutter→sink hauls; complete the edge set from the spec
   topology (each cutter's west-half output → a west-Region sink, east
   half → an east-Region sink, consistent within each lane). Route at
   `hop_range=MAX_HOP_RANGE`, single floor. Write it as a test or script
   under `tests/` — it is an experiment, not product code. Read the
   outcome:
   - **Converges** → routing capacity is proven at true scale; placement
     only needs to reproduce a columnar lane layout; tasks 3–4 are
     low-risk.
   - **Doesn't converge** → single-floor capacity is insufficient and no
     placement work alone fixes gate 2; 3-D routing (`lift_enabled=True`)
     is sanctioned and expected (§2a spec relaxation item 2). Retry with
     lifts; record overuse hotspots either way.

   **Result (2026-06-11): doesn't converge on a single floor; converges with
   lifts.** Implemented in `tests/wp_n_reroute_experiment.py` (not
   pytest-collected — `uv run python tests/wp_n_reroute_experiment.py`).
   Lifted the UNFINISHED Half Splitter (`contract_hops=True`: 16
   platform_in / 64 machine / 32 platform_out, 160 port_edges), completed
   the netlist with the 32 missing cutter→sink edges (8 partial lanes × 4
   cutters, paired to the 8 unfed sinks consistent with the existing
   west/east split — `NEW_SINK_FOR_SRC`), built 48 nets (16 fanout + 32
   fanin, all 4-terminal), and ran `strip_and_reroute(...,
   hop_range=MAX_HOP_RANGE, platform="Foundation_2x4")`.
   - **Single floor: structural failure in 8.4s**, before
     `MAX_ITERS`/congestion ever engages. `_grow_tree` raises on net 41
     (fanin) — terminal `(43, 28, 0)` unreachable from a 46-cell tree, **0
     overused cells**. Net 41 connects 4 cutter outputs at `x=44` (`y=26,
     28, 30, 32`) to sink `(57, 28)` on the *east* face — **one of the 24
     sinks the human already hand-routed**, so even topology with a
     known-feasible hand layout isn't re-derivable by PathFinder alone on
     one floor once all 48 nets compete for the same grid. Per
     `_grow_tree`'s own contract this is structural (leg/connectivity
     exhaustion), not congestion — rip-up in later iterations would not
     have helped, hence no MAX_ITERS loop and no overused cells to record.
   - **Retry with lifts: converges in 1.9s.** Floor 1 opened as a fully
     passable second layer (the human build uses only floor 0; confirmed —
     all 1562 entities are on layer 0), `RoutingGraph(lift_enabled=True)`,
     same `hop_range=MAX_HOP_RANGE`. 15 of 36 routable nets used at least
     one lift edge, mostly as up-then-down floor-1 "vias" past floor-0
     leg/congestion limits.
   - **Decision: 3-D routing is required, not merely sanctioned.** Tasks 3-4
     must produce/consume a lift-aware routing path. `strip_and_reroute`
     currently builds a single-layer `passable` set and doesn't expose
     `lift_enabled` — that plumbing (multi-layer `passable`, lift emission
     into the blueprint) is new scope for task 3, not yet built. The
     structural bottleneck found (net 41, cells `x≈43-45, y=26-32`) is the
     *first* one PathFinder hits in net-id order, not necessarily the only
     one — no broader hotspot survey was run since the lift retry already
     converged.

   **Correction (2026-06-11, review).** The "structural failure, 0 overused
   cells" reading above is wrong — it was an artifact of a product bug, not
   a property of the instance. Found while auditing the run (a sink the
   human hand-routed on one floor cannot be *structurally* unreachable on
   that floor — the existence proof forbids it):
   - **The bug:** `lift.kind()` returns `platform_in`/`platform_out` for
     *any* `PortReceiver`/`PortSender` (`lift.py` ~line 153), so
     `route.strip_belts` keeps the human's 145 interior launcher/catcher
     pairs and `strip_and_reroute` registers all **290 hop-endpoint cells
     as obstacles**. PathFinder fought a board with phantom walls the human
     never had (flood-fill stays connected; the walls kill leg-level
     reachability in the narrow slots, e.g. net 41's pocket). **Fix needed
     regardless of WP-N** (any reroute of a hop-bearing blueprint inherits
     phantom obstacles): make the strip/classify path position-aware —
     interior position distinguishes a hop endpoint from platform IO (the
     rule this spec already states in §2a) — e.g. strip `PortSender/
     Receiver` entities not on the platform boundary ring. Fold into task 3
     as item 3e.
   - **Corrected single-floor result (hop endpoints stripped): congestion
     failure, not structural.** `MAX_ITERS=60`: fails in 84s with **124
     overused cells** (vs. blocker 1's 3-cell flake at quarter scale —
     this is heavy congestion). `MAX_ITERS=300`: no convergence either;
     dies after 546s on a different mode — `_grow_tree` corners itself
     (net 10 fanout, terminal unreachable from its own 14-cell partial
     tree), i.e. farthest-first growth robustness, not capacity.
   - **Corrected interpretation.** Single-floor feasibility at true scale
     remains *theoretically open* (the human's completed local routing is
     a partial existence proof; the 15 long hauls were never proven
     single-floor-routable by anyone). What is settled: the **current
     router does not converge single-floor at this scale under either
     failure mode, while the 2-floor lift run converges in 1.9s even with
     the 290 phantom obstacles still in place** (a fortiori stronger once
     they're stripped). The decision — tasks 3–4 target lift-aware 3-D —
     stands, now for the right reasons.

2. **Generalize replication — DONE (2026-06-11).** Added `MACHINE_RATES`
   (machine type → belt fraction) next to `OP_TYPES` in `synth.py`, measured
   from the corpus: rotators 1/2 (`quarter_rotate_{180,cw,ccw}.spz2bp`, 8
   rotators / 4 lanes), `half_destroy` 1/3 (`quarter_destroy_west_half.spz2bp`,
   12 cutters / 4 lanes — matches machines.md's "1 → 3 → 1"), cutter fan 1/4
   (§2a Half Splitter arithmetic). `per_lane(machine_type) =
   ceil(1 / MACHINE_RATES[machine_type])`. `CutterSpec.cutters_per_lane` is now
   `int | None = None`, derived to `per_lane(CUTTER_FAN_TYPE) = 4` in
   `__post_init__` when omitted; existing call sites that need the
   placeholder 1-cutter/lane topology (still the only placeable shape until
   task 3 lands) now pass `cutters_per_lane=1` explicitly. Only `OP_TYPES`/
   cutter rates were needed, all measured — no QUESTIONS.md entry required.
   `Spec.throughput` is untouched (out of scope: a single shared value across
   a series chain's stages doesn't map cleanly onto per-stage rates, and its
   existing explicit values already match the table for every current use).
   273/273 pass + 2 strict xfails (4 new tests in `TestMachineRates`),
   `just lint` clean.

3. **Rework the placement model** (`place.py`):
   a. **Delete the 2-member adjacency — DONE (2026-06-11).** No
      replacement — proximity is already rewarded by the wire-length
      objective. See the §0 entry for the fix and its regression test.
   b. **Blocks, not rows, for replication groups — DONE (2026-06-12).**
      See the §0 entry for the full description. Summary: `row_y` per
      stage → `band_lo`/`band_hi` pair; each machine gets its own y
      variable within the band; pairwise fan-group ordering → block
      `lo_x`/`hi_x` via `min_equality`/`max_equality` (including
      second cells), cross-block ordering `hi[i]+1 <= lo[i+1]`; block
      filter lowered to `>= 1` machine child with an exclusive-ownership
      check (swapper groups excluded); weighted compactness penalty
      (2 × stage_mcnt × band_width) keeps bands collapsed to a single
      row when the topology doesn't demand vertical spread.
   c. **Scope the facing constraints — DONE (2026-06-12).** For
      machine→off-primary-face-sink edges: `m_r == flow_r` (machine faces
      the flow direction, not the literal sink position). Same scoping for
      off-primary-face-source→machine edges. Minimum spacing increased to
      3 for off-primary-face edges (prevents adjacent-cell routing
      competition). Xfail reasons updated: all topologies now place
      successfully; failure mode is PathFinder routing congestion.
   d. **Crossing budget capacity side — DONE (2026-06-13).** Routed all
      24 permutations of 4 groups on `Foundation_2x4` at `hop_range=5`,
      single floor. All inversion counts (0–6) converge; occasional
      1-cell failures at inv=4 are nondeterministic (CP-SAT placement
      variance + router tie-breaking). Capacity = C(n_groups, 2).
      `_check_crossing_budget()` in `place()` raises
      `CrossingBudgetExceeded` when exceeded. 3 new tests in
      `TestCrossingBudget`.
   e. **Routing plumbing surfaced by task 1 + the 2-floor viz review**
      (in `route.py`/`pathfinder.py`, small but load-bearing):
      - **Interior-hop stripping fix — DONE (2026-06-11).**
        `strip_belts` gained an optional `netlist` parameter:
        platform_in/platform_out entities whose cell isn't a node of
        `netlist` are stripped alongside belts. `strip_and_reroute` passes
        its `netlist` through. Without a `netlist`, behavior is unchanged
        (all ports kept) — a position-only check (`_platform_port_positions`
        membership, "on the boundary ring") was tried first and rejected:
        synthetic test fixtures place port entities at placeholder
        coordinates that don't match real platform geometry, so a
        geometry-only rule strips legitimate ports. Netlist-membership is
        the correct signal — `lift.trace_layer(..., contract_hops=True)`
        already excludes hop endpoints from `nodes`, so passing that
        netlist makes `strip_belts` agree. One existing test
        (`TestRootOnPort::test_root_on_port_cell_raises`) used an
        off-netlist `PortSender` as a generic obstacle; changed to a plain
        machine type (obstacles need not be ports). New regression test
        `TestStripInteriorHops` in `tests/test_route.py`: strips the
        UNFINISHED Half Splitter against its `contract_hops=True` netlist,
        asserts all 290 hop-endpoint cells are gone and all 48 platform IO
        ports remain. 275/275 pass + 2 strict xfails, `just lint` clean.
      - **Port-band passability fix — DONE (2026-06-11).** Added
        `pathfinder._build_passable(netlist, machine_cells, layer,
        platform=...)`: with a `platform`, `_platform_bounds`'s outermost
        ring (the 2-cell-band's inner port row, e.g. x ∈ {-18, 57} /
        y ∈ {2, 37} on `Foundation_2x4`) is excluded from `passable` except
        for cells that are `platform_in`/`platform_out` nodes of `netlist`
        (net endpoints) — that ring is **ports-only in-game** (the human
        build has 48 ports and zero belts/machines there; buildable area
        starts one cell inside, `viz._platform_geometry`'s inset=3).
        Without `platform`, behavior is unchanged (node-bounding-box +
        margin, no ring). `strip_and_reroute` now calls `_build_passable`
        instead of inlining the bounding-box loop. New
        `TestPortBandPassability` in `tests/test_pathfinder.py`: unit-tests
        the ring exclusion on `Foundation_1x1` (non-port ring cells out,
        net-endpoint ports + interior in, no-platform fallback unchanged),
        plus a `strip_and_reroute(platform=...)` round-trip asserting no
        non-port entity lands on the band — the first test to exercise
        `strip_and_reroute`'s `platform` kwarg at all.
        - **Finding: the band was load-bearing, not latent.**
          `test_single_lane_four_cutters_halves_land_on_correct_sides`
          (1 lane × 4 cutters/lane, `Foundation_1x1`, `hop_range=
          MAX_HOP_RANGE` — the smallest `cutters_per_lane=4` checkpoint)
          now fails: two fan nets oscillate forever between interior cells
          (9, 8, 0) and (11, 8, 0), `MAX_ITERS=60` and `=200` both end with
          the same single overused cell. Both cells are interior (not on
          the excluded band), and the costs are fully symmetric for both
          nets, so PathFinder's history pricing can never break the tie —
          a router tie-breaking pathology, not a capacity ceiling, and not
          specific to the port band. Marked `xfail(strict=True)` per the
          WP-N hints ("record it, don't tune around it"); resolution is
          either a PathFinder tie-breaker (e.g. deterministic by
          `net_id`) or task 3e.4's lift-aware reroute. 277/280 pass + 3
          strict xfails, `just lint` clean.
      - **Per-floor belt emission fix — DONE (2026-06-11).**
        `_cell_to_entity` no longer takes a `layer` argument; every emitted
        entity (belts, junctions, hop sender/receiver, lifts) uses the
        cell's own floor (`cell[2]`). See the §0 entry for details.
      - **Lift-aware `strip_and_reroute` — DONE (2026-06-11).**
        `_build_passable` gained `extra_layers` (each extra floor fully
        passable over the platform's bounding box, ring included) and
        `strip_and_reroute` gained `lift_enabled` (opens floor `layer + 1`
        as the extra layer and threads `lift_enabled=True` to
        `RoutingGraph`). See the §0 entry for the test and pass count.
   f. **Hop/lift cost calibration — DONE (2026-06-13).** Lowered
      `HOP_PENALTY` from 2.0 to 1.5 (sweep: 1.5 is the lowest value where
      all tests pass; 0.5 and 1.0 broke the 2-cutter test). Added
      `SYMMETRY_BREAK = 1e-4` tie-breaking bias to `_grow_tree`'s
      step/hop/lift cost computations: `(hash(nb) ^ net.net_id) % 997 *
      SYMMETRY_BREAK`. Resolved the 1-lane 4-cutter oscillation xfail.
      Upper-floor occupancy charging (correction 2) remains open — not
      blocking current work since lift-enabled routing is used selectively.

4. **De-xfail and re-gate — DONE (2026-06-13).** Output clearance
   constraint (`place.py`): within each fan-out group of multi-cell
   machines, pairs at the same x-column must have y-spacing >= 2 —
   prevents stacked cutters from chaining shapes (functional
   correctness). `lift_enabled` plumbed through
   `synthesize_cutter`/`_lower`/`synthesize`. `_MAX_RETRIES` raised 3→5.
   **1-lane × 4-cutter promoted to full end-to-end** (synthesis → routing
   → lift → interpret, correct halves, 0.1s). 4-lane and 16-lane remained
   placement-only (output clearance spread machines beyond router capacity
   at the time). Superseded by task 6.

5. **Housekeeping — DONE (2026-06-13).** Updated §0 status header
   (289/289, gate-2 state), §2a crossing budget (capacity side landed),
   §7.2 tasks 3d/3f/4 (all DONE), §7.3 scaling arc. I7 metric (synthesized
   belts vs. human build) deferred — requires re-running the task-1
   experiment with the fixed interior-hop stripping; not blocking.

6. **4-lane routing convergence — DONE (2026-06-13).** Root cause:
   all 4 sources assigned to the first port group (x=-12,-11,-10,-9);
   16 source→machine edges crossed the same x-buckets, forcing the density
   constraint to require channel height ≥ 16, pushing machines to y=19 —
   far from sinks at y=8-11. Three fixes:
   - **Source group-pinning** (`synth.py`): pin each source to a distinct
     port group (`i % n_src_groups`). Sources land at x=-12, 8, 28, 48;
     max bucket density drops to 4; machines land at y=8.
   - **Off-face-aware placement** (`place.py`): band ceiling capped near
     actual sink y; balance target shifted to `(input_y + avg_sink_y)/2`;
     ring-column avoidance penalty; low-y decision strategy.
   - **Router net ordering** (`pathfinder.py`): initial sort by descending
     HPWL; per-iteration critical-net-first resorting.
   **Result:** 4-lane × 4-cutter synthesis → routing → validate succeeds
   (~13s, 1 unmatched leg). Objective: 2952 (was 4672). 289/289 pass.
   **Remaining wall for 16-lane:** 4 sources per group recreates density
   bottleneck at group level — see §7.3 next steps.

**Hints / expected failure modes:**
- If CP-SAT is still infeasible after 3a–3c, bisect by re-enabling
  constraint families one at a time on the minimal reproducer
  (`lanes=2, cutters_per_lane=2, Foundation_1x1` — <1 s, deterministic,
  independent of seed).
- Do not chase single-floor convergence by raising `MAX_ITERS`: the
  task-1 correction measured it — 60 iters → 124 overused cells (84s),
  300 iters → a `_grow_tree` self-cornering dead-end (546s, a net's own
  partial tree boxes out its last terminal). If that self-cornering mode
  shows up *with* lifts enabled, it is a router-robustness bug worth
  fixing (restart the net's tree, or retry with a different terminal
  order) — record it, don't tune around it.
- Task 1's netlist completion needs lane-consistent sink pairing (a
  cutter's two halves go to *its* lane's west/east sinks). If the lifted
  partial netlist makes lane membership ambiguous, derive it from the
  splitter tree each cutter hangs off (contracted edges still connect
  `platform_in` → cutter).
- Do not weaken I4/I5 (round-trip isomorphism, physical validation) to
  make the gate pass; if a task appears to conflict with an invariant,
  stop and record it in QUESTIONS.md instead.

### 7.3 Sequencing & dependencies
- **Critical path:** A → B → C → D → E, each gated by the prior's invariant.
- A and B are cheap and unblock everything — done.
- C (the router) is the hard, high-value core. Single-cell round-trip, cell-level
  multi-cell ports, and spacious wide-fan chaining are green; the **last C gap
  (tight 2D fan packing) is now coupled to D** — the placer must leave routing
  room, so finish it inside WP-D rather than as a standalone router pass.
- F / G / H run in parallel whenever a stacker / painter / confidence need
  arises; none block the diagonal-extractor north star.
- New deps (§6): A/H add `networkx`; D adds `OR-Tools`. Nothing else.
- **Scaling arc (updated 2026-06-13): ~~I~~ ✓ → {~~J~~ ✓, ~~K~~ ✓, ~~L~~ ✓} →
  ~~M~~ ✓ → ~~N~~ ✓ (tasks 1–7 done; gate 2 at 4-lane end-to-end, group
  routing landed) → north star** (the Half Splitter + the 48→96 full-belt
  diagonal extractor).
  Gate 1 passes; gate 2 routing converges at 1-lane, 4-lane × 1-cutter
  (0 unmatched, correct halves), and 4-lane × 4-cutter (routing converges,
  16 machines placed). **Done (2026-06-13):**
  1. **Per-group density accounting (§7.3 step 1).** Density constraints
     now partition source→machine edges by source group: edges from different
     groups route through separate horizontal channel slices and are
     constrained independently. With group-pinned sources spatially separated,
     per-bucket density drops from 16 (global) to ~4 (one group's fan-out),
     machines land at y=7-13 (vs y=19). All 289 tests pass. `ch_edges` key
     changed from `channel_index` to `(channel_index, group_key)`.
  2. **Lift-hop entity emission fixes (§7.3 step 3, partial).** Three bugs
     in `_cell_to_entity` fixed: (a) `_unit_direction` added — hop edges span
     multiple cells, producing non-unit vectors `(5,0)` that didn't match the
     lift emit table's unit directions `(1,0)`; (b) `_cell_to_entity`'s lift
     in/out direction scan now checks `hop_edges` as fallback when `tree_edges`
     don't contain the continuation (lift exit → hop sender at the destination);
     (c) no-hop-from-lift-exit constraint added to `_grow_tree` — prevents
     placing a hop sender at a lift exit cell (same physical cell, two entities).
     **Lift-exit limitation resolved** in step 4 below.
  3. **4-lane × 4-cutter test upgraded** from placement-only to full synthesis
     → routing → lift trace. Routing converges in ~10s with lifts.
  4. **Lift-exit unmatched legs fixed.** Added `is_lift_exit` flag to `_Cell`;
     `_occupancy` marks lift exit cells (destination floor of a lift entity).
     `unmatched_legs` now skips output checks from/toward lift exit cells —
     their cross-floor connections are realized by the lift entity on the
     source floor, not by a same-floor entity. Result: 4-lane × 4-cutter
     L0 unmatched legs dropped from 4 to 0; L1 from 9 to 2. The 2 remaining
     L1 legs are a different category: consecutive hop catchers whose outputs
     conflict (the emit model assigns `BeltPortReceiverInternalVariant` which
     has `ins=frozenset()` — items arrive via hop flight, not adjacent cells).
     Test upgraded to assert `unmatched_legs(result, 0) == 0`.
  5. **16-lane routing failed.** Per-group density fix resolved placement
     (machines at y=7-13), but routing failed in 1128s: `net 25 (fanin):
     terminal (11, 14, 0) unreachable from tree of 57 cells`. The routing
     graph at 16 lanes (48 nets on Foundation_2x4) exceeds PathFinder's
     capacity — the negotiated-congestion loop can't find paths when the
     passable set is too congested. Separate from the density issue; needs
     either (a) a larger platform, (b) routing improvements (better
     heuristics, more iterations), or (c) decomposition (route groups of
     lanes independently).
  **Done (2026-06-13):**
  6. **Hop-receiver adjacency constraint.** Root cause: for fanin nets, the
     hop sender in growth direction becomes the item-flow receiver after the
     edge flip, and `BeltPortReceiverInternalVariant` has `ins=∅`.  If the
     sender already had outgoing step edges (from earlier terminal paths),
     they flip into incoming step edges that the receiver can't accept.  Fix
     in `_grow_tree`: (a) for fanin nets, block hops from cells with existing
     step-edge outputs (`cell_out > 0`) or adjacent to existing receivers;
     (b) for fanout nets, block hop destinations adjacent to existing
     receivers.  `item_recv_cells` set tracks cells that become receivers in
     item flow.  4-lane × 4-cutter L1 unmatched: 2 → 0; test upgraded to
     assert both floors at 0.  289/289 pass, lint clean.
  **Done (2026-06-13):**
  7. **Lane-group decomposition (§7.3 step 7).** Three improvements for
     scaling routing to 16 lanes:
     (a) `_assign_net_groups` + `_route_by_group` in `pathfinder.py`: nets
     partitioned by source port group; groups routed sequentially with
     retained inter-group occupancy (later groups see earlier groups' cells
     as occupied, steering away via congestion pricing). Joint fallback for
     residual cross-group overlaps. Activated when >12 grouped nets.
     (b) `pathfinder_route` convergence check scoped to own nets — prevents
     per-group routing from stalling on cross-group occupancy.
     (c) Routing speedups: lift-aware heuristic (adds LIFT\_COST for
     cross-floor terminals); stall detection (early exit when overused count
     plateaus over 15 iterations); configurable `max_iters`.
     291/291 pass (2 new tests), lint clean.
  **Next steps:**
  8. **16-lane routing convergence.** Group routing + lifts converges at
     4-lane (~11s). Scaling test in progress for 8/12/16 lanes.
  WP-L's region-internal flow ordering remains open and non-blocking.

### 7.4 Test infrastructure to build first
- `tests/conftest.py`: fixture loaders + the `CLOSED_FIXTURES` / `OPEN_FIXTURES`
  registry, and a `tiny_netlist(...)` builder (promote the helper from
  `tests/test_interpret.py::TestMultiPort`) for hand-built I4/I5 cases.
- Treat the deprecated `router.py` + `tests/test_router.py` as **out of the
  regression contract**; WP-C replaces them.
